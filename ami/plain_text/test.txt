okay everybody found his place again yeah that's nice okay so this is our second meeting and uh still failing
uh now we're going um into the functional design um
important thing of this phase is that we're going to uh try to
get an agreement about the user requirements technical function design and
the working design
so that we can move onto the second uh phase but first this phase
um first an announcement there's a little adaptation in the air conditioning
system so
there's our ghost mouse again that that means that you can have a little trouble with little trouble with the air conditioning that's because of this uh
it's in wing c and e so it should be over in a in a while couple of days
but it's going to be cold anyway so i don't think you're gonna need it then
our agenda now first the opening uh this time i will take the minutes
uh you're going to have a presentation all of you um
and we've got forty minutes for the whole uh prese for the whole uh presentations
so uh i suggest we take about seven minutes per presentation and then we can have a little discussion
about the new project requirements uh which have been sent to me
and then the decision on the control functions uh which we wanna include and those
which we don't wanna include so we've got forty minutes for all of it so i suggest um let's start
with the first presentation um who wants to be first
okay so
just maybe it's easier if you um yeah i think you will tell your presentation as well just which function you have and what you're gonna talk about

okay
thank you so anybody have um any questions until now
about functional requirements okay that's clear
now to the second

yeah
yeah you can take your time we've got uh plenty of time so

yeah there it is yeah
one remote


hmm
'kay
yeah
okay anybody has questions about the technical functions

yeah
touchscreen
huh
'kay that's nice uh
yeah
that's right uh maybe we can first um listen to your presentation uh and then we have a little discussion about the requirements and uh design

i think it's going to uh it's not too much okay
okay thank you
okay
uh
okay now i hope everybody has a little bit more insight in the functions we all have and what we are doing right
now um i'm the project manager so i'm here to mess things up and uh
tell you some new uh requirements
um that's we've uh got to design a um remote
which is only suitable for t v um that's because uh it
will be too complex and the time to market will be too big if we wanna have it uh
for more functions
so it has to be simple uh another point is we have to skip the teletext
because in the world of uh upcoming internet uh we think teletext
is going to be uh a thing of the past and uh it's a function
we don't need in our remote control
um internet is also mentioned in a function we can use uh maybe also on televisions it will be available as well
another one is uh the customer is uh forty plus uh that's the the market we have to to to target because we are going to develop a new product which is specially designed for the younger customers
um this is uh a bit pity for the marketing uh expert because
he was uh aiming on the the younger persons so we have to find a market which is above
forty plus uh but which will suit our
uh remote control and the other way round and we have to be very uh
attent in uh putting the corporate image uh in our product so it has to be visible in our design
in the way our device works and uh we have to be uh very
clear on this point as well so i suggest
let's have a discussion on the control functions
yeah
uh we can see if we can find a way uh between the functions we wanna use and the market we wanna reach with our product um

against the no teletext
um
yeah it's it is
standard remote
no i think we can
i think we can do a lot with the design and the simple buttons which were also mentioned
uh if we put a lot of effort in those we can make a remote control with uh just
two or three buttons or just a remote which is suitable for the market we wanna reach because it is forty
percent of the market
and um if you look in holland at the whole generation of forty plus fifty plus it it's the the biggest share of the of the whole population now
no
but don't you think that if we make a remote which is uh typically made for
this market that people think the people think that's the the device
i've looked for although i didn't realise it so let's try it
yeah
yeah it's a big success
very big success yeah
uh i think so as well
uh i simply think um

uh that the new products we are gonna make uh spef specifically design are designed for uh younger people uh so maybe we can focus ourself on the elderly people
and i think we have to um see what requirements we need
for those um remote controls 'cause what you told is the channel
selection is important volume selection power and teletext
okay um
no we we haven't voted yet so uh i think teletext can be uh
um can be a function as well but only if uh if it won't
higher the the cost because i don't know if it will be a lot more money to implement teletext as well but i don't think it will be a problem
or is teletext a
yeah
yeah so i suggest uh
yeah
is anybody um really against teletext
no just that that we just keep the teletext
i think that's a good idea as well especially for the subtitles
maybe we can
make that um
another point of advantage in our remote control if we uh make a k
a button ex for example for big subtitles which is instantly on the remote control
for elderly people they can think oh i wanna have subtitles and they push the button and they get the big subtitles
um so i think teletext can v can be very useful in our advantage um
functionality should be few buttons you said
i think uh that's very important we have a few buttons
so to keep it simple
no
yeah
but do you need
but do you need the buttons for one to zero maybe c we can
maybe we can use uh
no maybe we can implement the scroll button
or a joystick like
there are other ways too just look if you look at telephones the sony telephone has a scroll button which is very useful in searching names or
that's right
the numbers yeah yeah they can see how much buttons there are going to be on on the display and if it's too much we can uh reconsider it but i think there won't be very much buttons or there don't have to be a lot
the number of buttons i think it's very important in the in the design
you can make a very fancy design uh with putting the buttons on the right places and if you have less buttons you can do a lot more with
to operate only the t v yeah
no
so
'kay so we can
yeah
that's right
yeah so you suggest we could better um focus on for example the docking station
uh uh like other functions
instead of f of less buttons
mm no do you think the docking station will
uh is allowed in the budget we have
'cause it can be
no
yeah because i think that's uh
that's a good advantage point as well if we have a fancy looking docking station or very that's a nice requirement
docking station
i think so
yeah
that's a good point um
you said they easily get lost as well
yeah
so maybe we should implement the audio sign or something
yeah
yeah
yeah so audio signal should be possible as well i think it's not too expensive uh another
point is the l c d screen
um i don't know if that will rise the cost too much because
yeah it will be too much as well
yeah
based
just the l c d oh just the normal screen
that's a good idea so some extra info feedback
yeah i think that's a good idea as well
as the small screen
extra button info
i think that should be possible as well um let's see what
did we say mm more should be fancy to fancy design easy to learn
few buttons we talked about that docking station l c d um
general functions
yeah
'kay
and default materials
i think that's a good idea as well because um elderly people don't mind if it's a
titanium cover or just a plastic one so that doesn't really matter
so i think we nee
uh let's um specify the target group because are we talking about
elderly elderly people or people from forty to eighty because i
think what we're going to design now is for people above sixty maybe
uh what do we want if we want um a with uh for example the the telephone for elderly people we can
target the real elderly people
yeah
so that's the

now you're talking about sixty to eighty for example
yeah sixty
okay and different cultures are we
okay
no
we've got five minutes left just now small warning
should
yeah in different languages you know yeah
or you have to put a language button in it but that will be a bit unnecessary i think it's better
to put it on different markets with it all okay so that's the the target
uh then a few small things
uh okay i will put the minutes in the project uh project document folder
um what we're going to do for the next meeting is the industrial
designer will do the components concept user interface designer the user interface concept and the trend watching
so just keep in mind the things we've said about the target group uh requirements
and the trends which are uh going on and uh specific instructions will be sent
to you by uh the personal coach
so um i thank you for this meeting and i think we have a lunch break now
so that's a good thing
okay

mm
mm hmm
uh okay um i've been looking at uh the user interface of it um f for the techno f functions uh of of it um
okay
mm
oh
uh
okay
um yeah i think uh we uh must use the general functions uh
of the uh remote control uh uh i've do i've uh
done a little uh research on the internet and not much information about it
um about uh interface but uh uh
yeah i i've been thinking about a simple manner uh to put a lot of functions uh
uh in one um in one uh remote control uh so uh you've got a lot of devi uh devices
like uh d v d uh uh television uh stereo so um
but uh it must be uh user friendly so um uh you c you can't put a a lot
of uh functions uh in one uh yeah uh uh uh yeah
in one um remote control but um
yeah
um yeah got uh many functions in one uh remote control um but um yeah you can see this is uh quite simple uh remote control
um few uh buttons but uh this uh re uh remote control got a a lot of uh buttons um uh people uh don't like it uh so um
well what uh i was uh thinking about was um uh keep the general
functions uh like they are so uh like uh the on off uh button uh keep it uh yeah
l like a red button uh everybody everybody knows it so uh uh you don't have to change
that um
my personal uh preferences um use a display for uh specific uh functions of the different uh device so um
wh what i was th uh thinking about was um you've got um
uh this the remote control uh and uh you got here the general
functions uh like uh the on off button uh sound uh i dunno um
and um here you've got a s kind of a display
it's a touchscreen so um yeah you got a general f uh f the functions of the
device uh for a d v d player or uh so um the pl yeah um f
for uh playing uh reverse uh and um you got here uh real
buttons for uh selecting uh a device
so um this button is for a d v d or so um for every
um device you've got a uh a f a b a part uh
display of a part buttons so uh you you never got uh all the buttons
uh on w one device so uh that's uh my uh idea about it um
yeah and
uh let's see uh yeah so a touchscreen uh and um th
the buttons uh the real buttons uh we have to use um we better c um uh use
uh quite uh large buttons uh for um yeah everybody uh have to use it so
uh ol even even old people um young people so uh we must keep uh buttons uh quite s uh simple and quite large so uh um
yeah uh yeah
that was uh my uh part of it so
n i i don't think so uh you got uh quite a cheap uh touchscreen s um it's
uh not uh in colour or something uh it's just uh um one colo
uh yeah
uh i seen uh w uh something on the internet uh not today but uh a few uh weeks ago uh you got uh yeah quite an uh
a kind of uh touchscreen um and it's uh for
uh twenty uh euros or uh less uh so it's possible
yeah
yeah that's true
uh

okay
mm


mm
yeah
mm
forty
yeah

yeah
mm
mm

mm
yeah

but um deaf people need uh teletext for uh for subtitles so it's yeah
it's
mm
yeah yeah
yeah yeah
yeah
if it's only for televi yeah
yeah
yeah
so we can s we can skip the display so uh we don't need it
uh
yeah
yeah
mm
yeah
mm hmm
yeah
mm
mm
yeah
hmm
no

no
no
hmm
mm
hm
no
mm
okay yeah
yeah

mm
mm yeah
mm
mm
no
so 'kay
yeah
right
no yeah
yeah
yeah
no

well i think if we are gonna use a touchscreen uh we're gonna go way above the twelve and a half euros
but the it wouldn't be very robust it's very fragile and you can get scratches on it
that's
okay
okay i've got a presentation about the working design um first about how it works
it's really simple of course everybody knows how a remote works the user presses a button the remote determines what button it
is uses the infrared to send a signal to the t v the t v switches to the frequency or
what function it is
so we've got um the the plate it gots conductive disks
for every button when the user presses a button a signal got sent goes to the led and
transmits tranmi transmits its to the t v
it's a very simple device technically speaking so this is a schematic overview
you've got the buttons the power source and uh when a button gets pressed
its goes to the chip the chip uh controls the infrared bulb and
perf perhaps a normal bulb when you press a button you can actually see your pressed button
well um i think we should use default materials simple plastics keep the inner workings
simple so it's robust uh i think we should focus on aesthetics the design and the user
interface because if you're going to use high tech materials the price is going to go sky high
and uh you only have to design a remote once and if you use high tech materials it come back in every product
so it's in my idea it's uh it's gonna be smart to invest in di in design and not in uh in the product itself
that's it

i think that if we're if we put our marketing right um we can sell this just like um i don't know if you've heard about it in the news the the elderly mobile phone
yeah if we if we make a remote control just l with that idea in mind we could make tons of money i think we don't have to focus on on on the on the design then but on functionality we just
change our focus on the project and i think
we can uh we can sell this
no
uh that's a good idea
yeah and besides that it's um if we're gonna focus on elderly people they'll have to adapt they're not used to using scroll buttons so perhaps we should s stick to the basic layout
it should be possible yes if it's not too fancy and if the remote stays rather small it should be possible yeah
yes
so we're just gonna focus on the extras
yeah
like with your key chain if you whistle it goes uh it makes a sound
yeah
y i um i think we'll have to choose between the docking station or the screen 'cause
it's uh

well i don't think they have different television sets uh
in uh every country
'cause
yeah
yeah
yes
yeah

okay
no
yes
think i'll go first

'kay my name is freek van ponnen i'm the market expert but you already knew that
um i've done some research we have we uh have been doing research in a usability lab where we observed
um users operating remote controls uh we let them fill out a questionnaire
we had one hundred of these uh test subjects
uh in addition we did some market research uh see what the market consists of what ages are involved
well these are three quite astonishing results i thought um remotes are being considered ugly f uh seventy five percent of the um
people questioned uh indicated that they thought their remote were was ugly um and an additional eighty percent indicated that they would spend more money on a fancy looking remote control so
um in addition remotes were not very functional fifty percent of the people indicated they only loo used about ten percent of the buttons on a remote control
and fifty percent of the people indicated that their remote tended to get lost in their room
so
some things
then we did some research to the most relevant functions channel selection and volume selection um
both got a ten on a scale of one to ten for relevancy the power button got a nine
and teletext got a six and a half so these are the most
most uh important functions on a remote control then there are some one time use function that's
what i like to call them that uh audio settings video settings and channel settings buttons
which are not really used very frequently but are still considered to be of some importance
um channel selection was also indicated to be used very frequently one hundred and sixty eight times per hour
then these are the this is the market um sixty percent of the market consists of users between the ages sixteen and forty f six
um
main characteristic of this group is that they're very critical on the remote control um they like to use new f new functions but they also are very critical they won't spend their money very easily so
um the users of forty six to sixty five years cons the make up forty percent of the market
they are not really very interested in features but they do tend to spend their money a lot easier
um
what i think this indicates for our um
design i think we should make a remote for the future and this means we would
um have to focus on the age ages sixteen to forty five
uh this also makes up most the biggest part of the market so that will also be where our main profit would be gettable
um this would mean we would have to make a fancy design
um
the results also indicated that um about one quarter of the people questioned thought that the remote control caused r s r s i
um this is certainly something to take into account and thirty four percent thought
that it was hard to learn a n how to operate a new control remote control so these are
two factors that i think should be included in the design besides of course that the remote must look
very nice
and the functionality
as a lot of people indicated they only use about ten percent of the buttons i think we should make very few buttons uh this will also be uh beneficial to the design of the remote
uh i think the most frequently used buttons should be emphasised especially the channel selection and audio uh selection buttons 'cause they're used most and so they should be robust they shouldn't break down easily
um
then as mo as a lot of people indicated that their um remote got lost in the room it might be
and i say might be because it would um certainly boost the uh production
costs a lot but it might be a good idea to make a docking station and this would could get a button
in it which would send a signal to the remote which would then beep
so you'd know where it is in the room and in addition to this it could um recharge the batteries in the remote if you put it in
then um a surprisingly great deal of people w indicated that um an l c d screen in the remote control would be preferred this was um
mostly people in the age of sixteen to twenty five but up till
forty five it remains feasible this would also greatly increase the production costs but
i think these are just some small factors we could consider
that would be all
any questions
'kay

yeah you should go to the top thingy slide show oh yeah
hmm
well it would certainly make a fancy design
so
that is true
we would have to look into that
yeah





so is there any discussion possible about the new product requirement
yeah 'cause you're you're saying that teletext is gonna be an old feature and
it's not gonna be used anymore anyway pretty soon and new t v s will have internet access on them
but i think if you're targeting people of forty plus the chance that they will have a t v with internet
access
within the next like twenty years is very slim
in addition people indicated that teletext simply was an important feature for the remote control so i think it's pretty dumb to put no teletext feature on it
i'm pretty much against it
yes
besides that i think the market for forty plus is like
pretty small
but i mean if i s if i see this it's i think we're just gonna go for another
pretty
and not innovative
remote control
yes but it's not the biggest part of the
market
and besides that they're not very critical so i mean they don't really care
what the remote control is like they'll just pretty much take the first thing they see and which looks acceptable
no
i think that would be the case in the
sixteen to forty five age category
because they are critical and they they want to have a fancy remote control
people of forty plus i mean they want it to work but
as soo as soon as it works it's okay with them
so
i haven't heard of it
hmm

yes
yes
but obviously the board tends to disagree
yeah also
i think it'd definitely be a bad idea not to include teletext
yes
mm hmm
but
i don't think that's really an issue any more 'cause
well might be
but i mean it if it's only for t v you're not gonna need a lot of buttons anyway you need a one to zero button next channel previous channel
volume up volume down and some teletext buttons but
i think if you if you only l
nah
think if you're gonna include teletext you do i think many people like to use that 'cause if you should if you want to switch from channel one to like thirty five you don't wanna push the next channel button thirty five times
that's true but um
i don't think there are many t v s that can switch channels that fast and so you would need like
the t v would need an a function where you can actually view all channels and scroll through it
and i dunno if many channels would
do have that if many t v s have that
mm hmm
but i don't think i think if you're gonna make a remote control only to operate a t v you there's not much you can gain on
um having as few buttons as possible 'cause i think there are pretty many remote controls that can only operate a t v which already only have the minimum number of buttons i don't think there's much to be gained in that area
yeah
that is true but i think there's simply not much to gain on the competition when you when you're making a remote control only for to operate only the t v
'cause if you have a a remote control only to operate a t v there's simply not a lot of buttons required
there's not a lot of functions required so most existing remote controls simply don't have a lot of buttons either
so i think it would be very hard to actually gain on the competition here
that would that would cost a a big marketing
expedition
which was
one of the arguments to make it only for the t v because we didn't have the time to market a lot
maybe
well
yeah i think mean we obviously need a good way to position all the buttons and
but i don't think we should spend very much time in that

yeah i think maybe we should do some research into
what elderly people like to have in a
like to have extra in a new remote control
yes well fifty percent of the people indicated that remote control tended to get lost
yeah that was what i suggested you have it on yeah you have it's on some phones too which have a docking station and you just press a button and the phone goes ringing
so you know where it is
i think since a lot of people indicated that a new remote control is hard to learn and we're focusing on elderly people here which
tend to have a hard time understanding new devices it might be a good idea to have just a little screen on it
which would explain a button if you press it which would tell you what it does
and it wouldn't have to be touchscreen or a very expensive screen but
just a small screen with two
yeah
but i dunno if that would
that would fit into the
costs
no
i think probably elderly people would be a little bit more careful with their remote controls than
youngsters
yeah
i think
i think that would be a if we should do something like that it would be a i think it would be really good for uh for the image of the company
and i think i think there would be a good market for it
if we're able to really bring an innovative product
yeah the really
but
i'd have to look into that a little more
'kay and with uh the little screen in it which explains the buttons you could i think we n it would be a lot easier to
adapt it to different cultures
yeah
yeah

'kay
that's good

so uh good morning i see you all find your places is everybody sitting on the right place yeah i guess so so
let's see
first i will introduce myself i don't know if uh if everybody knows me so i'm bart hello hello bart hello hello bart welcome
uh let's see uh let's start off um with a little presentation
uh
now first i'll tell you a little bit about the setting you can see there are a few cameras here they'll record uh
our actions and you'll have wires and microphones that will record your voice
uh there are also some microphones there but th um you don't have to pay a lot of attention on those
because it will uh disappear when you don't attend to it so
is there a project documents folder there are some notes in it already i see some documents
uh i'll start with the presentation kick off
is being modified by the administrator uh okay let's do it read only
well i don't know if you've noticed but uh we're working for real reaction uh
it's a company in uh electronics we put fashion in electronics uh we make it
work uh we put a lot of effort in design and in the product itself
i'm bart the project manager so i'll direct you through the project
this is our agenda
uh we have our opening acquaintance tool training project plan description closing
uh maybe i can sit down then i can take some notes or let's see
maybe you can take the minutes once in a while i dunno it's not a lot of work but just uh if you hear
something uh you can write down just write it down uh as you can see uh it's the opening
aquaintance tool training aquaintance is a point we've done a bit um have you all seen
the corporate website already yeah have you seen any flaws in it
i think i found one no
i can
see if it works this way no it doesn't work here okay no
problem but um on the corporate information side there's a th uh
there was real remote instead of real reaction real remote is not really the company we're we are
but it's just a little fault um okay what
are we going to do uh our project aim is as you can see a new remote control
it has to be original trendy and user friendly so these are uh
the points why uh we also hired you we've got the
marketing expert for uh the trendy and user friendly look
and industrial designer uh there's also user friendly and a bit original
and we've got our user interface designer he's also uh
that's about the new remote control
uh project method um is uh there are three phases
we are going through first is functional des uh design individual work meetings
after the functional design then the conceptual design and the detailed design
i had some role indications on here
but i think you know it already by yourself the industrial designer is going
to work on the working design uh components design and a bit of the look and feel design
uh the user interface designer is going to do the technical function design user interface
concept and user interface design and the marketing expert is
doing a little bit of user requirement specification trend watching and project uh product ev evaluation
so that's a bit what you're going to do but that will be all worked out in uh other meetings
then we've got our first tool training we are going to work with a lot of high tech tools here
so it's ab it's handy if we have a little bit of training first as you can see we've got the smart
boards here and here in the white board um
in the white board here there's a little tool bar on this side here are some functions
you can save n uh these functions we don't have anything to do with only undo you can undo a little
uh piece of drawing a blank new document for each person uh select a pen
eraser capture we don't have to do anything with uh then we've got
our pen this pen it's really funny because you can draw with it on this page
um in the think it is form of you can
also select the current colour and the line width but then first you have to select the pen function
but we're going to work with it in a minute so okay uh
that's very simple and it's easy to uh draw your findings and drawings on there
uh then
a short thing about documents we've got our shared folder uh project project
what was it project documents i think but all you will found that already because
there are a lot of documents in it already so it will be okay and these are available
on the smart boards as well so if you have a document you wanna show just open it from the folder
here is a simple tool bar it's what i just said it's save print move back or forward one page you can switch between the different drawings
and then we're going to try out the white board
so as you can see we g all going to draw a animal just to uh uh just to get a bit familiar with it mouse wasn't running away
is everybody is anybody playing with the mouse no okay we're going to uh draw animal
and uh just sum up a few of its favourite characteristics um
the only thing we have to uh look after is that we use different colours and different line width
uh there's i can start from now i will you can use
this pen by holding it like a like a little child because if you hold it like this the sensors will
get blocked and then the drawing won't get good
another thing is you have to be uh a bit slow 'cause if you're going to draw like really
fast then um the pen won't hold up so we choose form of current
colour uh i think grey is appropriate
then the line width i think seven will be nice
now you'll see my drawing capabilities these are not very much but uh
uh see you have to do it real slow

oh

ah i was trying to draw a dolphin but i think his nose has to be a little bit but it's close
so what yeah it's this is bit of the swordfish yeah he hasn't got an eye
woah now we've got another function we've got the eraser and then you can undo
this easily
ah it's okay and i've got to write down a few of its characteristics uh is
they've got no text tool no
uh
okay this is typically a undo action i think pen
maybe you have to hold it a bit
upside down i think that's it because if you wan ar are going to do it like this then it will be a stripe but i don't know i'm just trying
this is not my work okay maybe you have to use
oh
uh i think it's a it wants to draw a another animal i don't know
it lives for the fun
so
it's my characteristic uh characteristic about the dolphin it lives for the fun so now i'm gonna hand over the pen on the new blank sheet to you go ahead
maybe it's easier to draw the smaller line width i think because this is going a lot better than uh i did

it's nice

uh
it's a real dead sheep yeah for recognition yeah i see
um maybe you can also write your name somewhere on just a

yeah
nice
sweet
yeah just a blank sheet

no

yeah it's pretty skinny cat
is your cat or did you find him on the street
ah

okay that's pretty clear so everybody knows how to work with the white board now
so if you have any ideas or if you wanna draw anything on the white board just ask and go ahead
it's pretty uh easy
'kay s haunted white board so we've got the tool uh introduction we
move along to the project finance um as you can
see we um for our remote control a selling price is uh twenty
five euros our selling price uh our profit aim is fifty million euros
uh that's the least we have to get from our remote controls so we have to work together to
reach our aims uh we can do it international so we have to focus
on different kind of users different kind of cultures and different kind of trends as well um
but that's all in the later stadium
our production cost um can be maximal twelve and a half euros
so that's also a point we have to keep in mind that we won't make remote controls
with small televisions inside and stuff like that it won't work so just
try to remember these points selling price twenty five profit aims fifty million um
but more important is the int international market we're trying to focus on and production
cost uh maximal twelve and a half euros
so that's leads us to our little discussion we've got about five or ten minutes
left for discussion so i'm gonna sit down i think it's easier
i've got a message five minutes okay that's uh good timing
uh maybe you have to say the magic word
does it do anything
maybe you have to just clap it down
mm back up again
no slide show hmm
it's off now you have to put it back o oh yeah you'll be okay i think
well it's those laptops
nice okay but so mm does everybody has um experiences with
uh remote controls and i mean not the ordinary mote controls but also a little bit different ones
like you can use for other no you

ah yeah
yep yeah i've i've got one at home and you can uh program i think
eight different devices in it and you can use it for your television anything else and it also
operates on infra red so you have to got the little device inside your room and
then you can operate it from the third or th or second floor so that's pretty handy
when you have a video recorder or d v d player downstairs and you've got a link to your t v on the second
floor so that's a pretty handy um
thing
um but only the
i think that if you can put different kind of devices in one remote control it makes it a lot easier as well it's uh
that's good to remember
yeah that's nice i think so we've we want different functions
uh and we can maybe see if we can do something with the infra red but i don't know if that will exceed the production costs so that uh that's something we have to find out i think
and other functions for a remote control
maybe we can make it uh uh
shock proof
sure
waterproof
okay so these are our um a few things we can think of um i will put the minutes from this meeting uh in our project folder
that's a battery stays
yeah
uh
that's an idea as well other ideas
quick ideas
okay any questions about this uh presentation kick off presentation
no
okay then i'll put the minutes from this meeting in the project folder
and then we can all work
finish meeting now okay and we can all work uh on our own projects
okay then i'll meet you in about a half an hour i think so good luck
morning
i'm

yep
hmm

okay yeah
yep
hmm
okay
yeah



okay


sure



yeah yeah


okay

hmm
a sheep



okay um i'm just gonna draw its uh head but mm
let's see
mm
uh

okay

yeah you know what that is
or who
ah okay yeah
just a
mm guess
so uh
yeah that's enough

um you say a blank or
okay





five minutes okay
mm

mm
oh really
huh
it's a
sure yeah
okay yeah yeah
okay yeah
hmm
oh
mm hmm
oh
mm
mm hmm
sure yeah
waterproof or uh
uh you never no know uh i w i mean uh
'kay
okay yeah
mm
mm
yeah

okay yep
morning




mm hmm






garfield
well i was gonna draw a cat too so i'll just try something else something different than garfield
mine is a bit more skinny
but uh


well it's supposed to be a cat i like cats because uh
they are uh
independent
the pen
so
the pen

no me neither
nope they were all mentioned so
okay
morning
yep
my name's frank
thank you
hmm that's interesting

sure
yep visit it
can't say i paid much attention to it but
oh yeah
okay

'kay

that was interesting
innocent



'kay


i'm thinking about a swordfish


meat

yeah

hmm

okay
thank you
okay
gonna use a different line width
and i'm gonna draw in black
there 'kay i'm not much of an artist but here we go
mm
okay this is my um hmm
sheep
with of course
little blue dot they always get sprayed on their butts
there
yeah
'kay
they are
come on
you have to go really slow when you're writing
they're brilliant animal animals and that's just a little me thingy
so
guess i'll pass the pen to our user interface designer
interesting
a rabbit garfield yeah
yeah
and the most interesting tail

yeah

we're being haunted

yeah you got a message
so just on a side note why is it my laptop is only giving me a black screen
yeah right
no
it's off now
well it was on but
ah there we are

well we have a
kind of broad t v at home and a d v d player so we got like a lot of remote controls one
for the t v one for the video recorder one for the d v d player and i think it's it
would be best to just make one remote control that can operate them all
oh really
yeah
yeah
so i think you can take minutes again
since it's your job
yeah
yeah but that would be really good if we could do that
um
think it has to be shock proof
'cause
my remote control tends to fall a lot
so
yeah one other little thing thought it might be handy to put a battery status display on it
so you can see
how much is left in the battery
but they'll also really drag up the production costs so think we'll have to see about that too
but maybe just a little led i don't know
um
nope don't think so
okay
aye sir
half an hour
okay
forget every time that the
where did my oh it's it's stuck here
yeah
okay keep an eye if i'm dropping this 'cause just seem ah as i said it doesn't
seem very s perhaps sweater or maybe if i set it
here on the this brand thing
are they on yeah on
okay
what was that a answer well okay i was just about to




you could change your project do a p h d or uh yeah
i haven't created it


i i do



yeah shoulda run the i l in that directory yeah
sounds good
oh
it's good thing yeah

yeah i'll do it

hey zoe
it's good



who
what
okay

it's just very quiet

oh
yeah
it's like i'm only interested in this guy 'cause he seems to be funny so what is it



like instead of the

oh
we have the g big yellow one maybe no huh
yeah yeah that
would be good ah no
oh


yeah
we have to remember to include that in our evaluation how they did the gif improve your browsing experie
sorry


i guess that's why we have a separate speech lab yeah yeah um
'kay yeah yeah
i ran in some troubles with the indexing but uh f found another package i instead of writing it from um the scratch 'cause it well i don't know um just now but i haven't played around it that much but
we'll see what happens in the next few days
yeah we'll think about that
i can send you right now like
um
c

yeah
yeah i didn't expect this course to be so much about java but uh feels like it's it's a java course more than anything else it's just like
yeah
so
we change it to friday yeah
i guess that's not
yeah
no so we
yeah that would be more reasonable 'cause the i l is friday
what oh yeah you have your presenta right whatever it's too much now well but yeah monday
we'll try and do monday um i mean we could
should we meet up monday
or
should we
yeah
just sh like w
yeah just
yeah
okay
okay yeah
yeah
well so he's supposed to give us test subject did he say that or what
okay
'cause we're gonna get an email on our uh m s c list saying from steve we need volunt yeah
yeah
well th they gonna u need us they're gonna need us for like perception projects and
things like that so yeah we need to use each
other for those
yeah that's true

yeah

yeah yeah yeah yeah and then one's supposed to be a
woman and one's supposed be a man and one
i don't know oh yeah
yeah okay
should we just yeah
yeah
yeah it's tuesday the twenty second
yeah
i think so
well uh
what oh it's a thursday yeah so it's not the yeah

it's not a good friday if if that's
it's not a good friday if it's a deadline
no
can have a look
the report yeah no okay oh no we p
i thought we would
oh

yeah oh we have three s p two

aren't you
oh yeah

oh yeah
in our uh timeline we r put in twenty fifth and that's the friday i think
yeah i'm just that's why i'm trying to find his his dates whatever
we're planning on having a big party on the twenty fourth so
end of lectures
oh it's actually twenty fourth
yeah
did he say anything about like h what he expects of the final report and stuff like length or
only
i mean how long we're this
one two
yeah 'cause this i mean we have interim report of seven pages and that's we can y yeah we could p probably just expand that
i mean 'cause it i mean a lot of it's gonna be the same thing
yeah and then i mean write about the evala evaluation and stuff that's gonna be quite a few pages but
so i don't think
page is gonna be problem
but uh



mm
can i have it
well the one meeting
um it should be fairly simple to just get the topics and the summaries fro using that text extractor thingy you wrote ray
you just like or
yeah
excuse me i just realised i haven't done that part yet
to have for the start up oh to have for the start up uh huh


yeah g uh that was li like yeah if i'll make a just index
what
well i i mean i i'm f it's not first priority maybe but don't know but uh
yeah

yeah
yeah yeah i guess we just
see what steve says about the re evaluation and then like we'll keep in touch by email if we need
anything i guess we will see you on thursday
and monday
d n l g
we can just email if we need other
i guess
hooray
okay
oh dear this doesn't stick at all
what rena what this bit or this b
like this
i sabotaged it

yeah mine doesn't stick today either
who wants to write summary

oh
i'll do it

um have you changed the the file yet
oh
yeah yeah i forgot that actually
yeah no when we um when you said at the beginning i thought must check the read write and then i never did it
no alright
mm hmm
mm g yeah uh
yeah

yeah yeah exactly yeah yeah
make browsers for the rest of the night

there is a file in the directory called disful
i ho what is it

oh right yeah that's right yeah yeah
oh right well
j do you want remo move that just n just for nicety

yeah yeah and really


oh it's huge several gig i think
yeah something like that yeah
has anyone had time to to play with it
any comments
um
oh right
might as well yeah i mean yeah the thing is that yeah there is as i said a while ago there
is still this one error which is a bug in in n x t um that r r always
generates these i think when you when you left click or right click or something i can't remember now
um but if it's a real error then it it stops so you can't do any any more good good good

yeah
okay
yeah be good is there any any comments you have about just like wording and or some sort of minor things
hmm
yeah i know at the moment as well the whole windows that pop up are not pretty at all but um you know i would make them a bit nice if i had more time but at the moment it doesn't look like that so i will if



but that took me so long to do this bloody start window nasty so i'm quite glad that it looks you know ni nice on one or this kind of thing
no this is just yeah

alright
that's odd yeah
try that a few times yeah i
started i started using
your um um the speak i don't know if you've seen that in the yeah
yeah yeah yeah but it's good your your stuff is really coo good it's got a good interface and easy to use it's nice
right
well wouldn't won't we include that then yeah
it's when they say mm uh huh yeah
yeah
i don't know if that's very useful because everyone does it it's very
really
they're asleep i think
so which you know suggest maybe you can suggest a few that which which would be interesting to list like three or four or something
mm hmm
very nice
mm hmm

but
i mean do we do we care if you know why not w i think you know it'd be it'd be difficult
but it would be difficult if you know if in the um speaker characterisation window we had a heading you know top five dialogue acts and then then the little brackets but they're not actually the top five but top five minus the most common ones which are you know
because
for the speaker yeah
no i wouldn't yeah
exactly yeah
yep yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah just do top five both local and global and then have another
um but then we want a selection of three or four maybe interesting ones and then
you followed all this up
yeah see and that's what speaker characterisation gives you
who's the one who dr
yeah
yeah
um so is is this percentage then um if you
say like um joke for this speaker is percentage i don't know twenty
is that the ho what percentage of his speech is joke or w how what percentage
of the jokes
are jokes yeah yeah
okay
yeah
yeah
yeah yeah i mean just keep it simple as
um
you will yeah
yeah
sounds good
yeah i was thinking that um it sort of turned out that way a bit didn't it
i don't know does it matter
oh i was
mm
i have one one m one little question that i reckon we should have a little icon for our browser

well no the thing is um in yeah in the the top left at the moment they've got an x which is you know n x t and it's sort of a bit cheeky to use that so
no we want something original what do you suggest we could the only thing i could think of was an m but
we'd be sued for that i think
yeah
yeah um
i mean it's tiny so we can't really put more than one character really or one sort of simple gif
no well i can dr
yeah
well if you find anything then send it to me
otherwise i'll i'll make up some m
i'm not sure actually i'm thinking yeah
yeah yeah yeah i i know yeah i know how to how to put it there but i'll have to import it somehow i'm not quite sure but
yeah yeah probably
yes
oh yes
no no uh
if
if the sound card is registered to your name which it usually is not and you have to re boot and sometimes it still doesn't work then yeah


um
mm hmm

yeah
in fact it's a n x t package
yeah
i mean sometimes they have methods that don't have any explanation to them at all so you just like right i'll try this then and see what it gives me

hmm
friday
i thought it was friday
yeah i think we both should yeah
well that's the problem because steve hasn't given us any details has he
that's true
i i'm sure we could do that in like a meeting
and make it up together yeah
um
the thing is yeah we had the the deadline last friday but we won't be able to do any evaluation during the weekend anyway so i think we could set monday
and that would give us the whole weekend


i don't know i think it was
yeah
yeah exactly yeah at the end we'll say yeah but you never gave us any test subjects
well sort of that's how i understood it he would he would make something up ha yeah find some people that's how i understood it um the thing is you know
yes um i think if we if we don't get anything from him then we should just do our friends basically
well they're your friends so they should
but it's not gonna take long it's only only gonna be half an hour maybe
um
maybe yeah well it will be yeah it'll have to be yeah
hmm
so

really i was thinking of like ten fifteen
uh
really
really
how can you get a range of people if you have three
one art student
yeah
yeah and hen we should just have two yeah oh dear um
another thing um we have the we have the um the presentation on like in one and a half weeks or something whatever it is or nearly two weeks
oh is tu yeah it is two weeks then do we have to have done the evaluation by then
it's the thursday no the thursday i think i think it's the thursday
is that good friday already
wow
no
well it i'm sure on the web site it says thursday hmm

well you know the the question is i do we need the evaluation for the presentation
we should definitely ask him because if not then
yeah you might be right
because we need to write a presentation as well
exactly me too that's the point
yeah yeah well i'm not free after this monday but i'm free at like after the eighteenth
because because i don't have anything after the eighteenth apart from this
well that's in on the eighteenth mm hmm

ooh
so um

so
anyone fancy writing him an email
that yep and
but it's still important to know so we would def
yeah yeah yeah i mean we need to know that anyway to prepare the presentation in the first place and um
what was the other one
basically how is how is it going with your evaluation proposal have you got people yet for us or what are you thinking and when
no
do we know did he ever say how long it was supposed to be
mm it's gonna be a lot
but we can write a lot i mean i think we should we should write everything
seven pages oh
true
yeah we can n
yeah should be good
so do you wanna write him an email then that'd be good
um
and uh when i get home today which will be before
um
before half past six i will make that file readable writable everything
uh uh well i i will
well i will i will need your snippets of code or it'd be good if i had them by tomorrow evening
oh i was gonna ask um
at the moment your search window
how is it organised
but at the beginning it when you haven't searched yet is it is it just is it still divided into two and the bottom half is just just empty okay
and then if you i don't know double click on one
okay
yeah
yeah yeah yeah
hmm
well y y this this is the icon by the way
um yeah maybe you wanna do um left handed um yeah one left click um highlights the the result in whatever you've got open
which other ones
um yeah usually one left click it's highlights it cross highlights everything i think yeah
mm well it's difficult because
well you could look up
mm no that's difficult because it the transcription window does cross highlighting
in a very awkward way because it has to find the topic first that was that was a pain
and um when you when you g um right click on a topic it pops open the list of meetings
that contain that pop po topic and um and that works when you when you
left double click on a topic oh on a meeting sorry then it loads it
so you could
you could take that for loading
so if we have that um the same on this one at least that you if you double left lick then it loads
mm
highlights um yeah i mean a hi obviously highlights whatever you've clicked on here but also highlights um
actually it's difficult because
because you n you don't you only ever have one meeting open and those results will be op i well i suppose if you have a if you have a local search then it could cross highlight
because you know if you get back several different meetings here and you've only got one meeting open then you can't cross out anything
okay
what do you mean by multi select
mm hmm oh okay
oh i see what you mean yeah okay
well i i i in any case if you left click on on a result that is contained in the meeting that is currently open then it should cross highlight if not it can't so
can you make
is it d very difficult to make another another gui but only for a global search
just just take that away the the local check box because um hmm
yeah because in the start up screen you can't have a
yeah would you make that that'd be really handy everything else can just stay the same you know in fact you can just leave everything as it is and just remove the check box
radio button
mm

okay
are we done
hmm
okay


ooh there you go doesn't wanna stay
yeah

no it won't
yeah the fun and games yeah
yeah yeah
seems unlikely
it's an excel s s x dot x s l
doesn't st have anything in it oh it does it has about three lines of x m l that didn't do much i think yeah what's that
it just seems to be occupied the place is alright doesn't matter really there's plenty in there
i had lots of stuff in there yesterday that did you see loads
of stuff oh no they live there but there's i had even more stuff there yesterday i was unzipping all this kind of crazy
huge things that were enormous i needed them they were for this though it's alright but uh
yeah it's uh it's about yeah it's so i think there's about eight gigs on there so yeah it's no problem it's just much bigger than all of our home directories combined isn't it
yeah i had a play with it um yesterday uh no it was good really yeah i liked it um
uh
it uh generated a lot of exceptions in the background but they didn't cause any problems but it just
uh yeah i didn't discover any of those yeah i did have a look i prodded it
to see if it'd break but it didn't break too m i didn't play that long but um it seemed alright really yeah and it the the th the
start up's great looks quite good looks alright and so yeah yeah
no looked alright the only the only thing is the it's not the start up screen is not too pretty but uh the the s it doesn't matter too much
no it's not it's not it's not a um it's not the top priority is it
yeah i think it'd look better on windows as well actually 'cause um it java uses the native windows doesn't it so
yeah
but we don't
no
do they yeah

well the um the um speaker characterisation is finished
i haven't done it i haven't updated all those object files though 'cause it takes ages on these computers so i do it it's faster for some bizarre reason if i log in at home and then run the code it runs it much faster than if i do it here but
but that's why i just can't to sit in the lab and wait half an hour or whatever it takes
yeah no i tried that but l yeah
it'll really speed it up yeah yeah

i saw that yeah i saw that it it doe it's tells tells you what speakers uh are in which meeting and then you can see which topics which topics yeah something like that yeah
yeah the um th the dialogue acts are all done and they're quite amusing some of them but there's
some of them some of th the thing actually what i wanted to talk about dialogue acts was um there are some that occur all the
time that i just and i don't know how interesting there are so the fir one statement is that it will b i'd removed
it 'cause w it was like everything is prefixed by statement every single dialogue act starts with statement and um
so everybody's top statement so it
so i got rid of that and then everybody the next one seems to mostly be back channel well i don't know what that means who knows what back channel
is that what that means oh keep that then um and then the others are quite
yeah some people don't though there are some people who don't do that actually yeah you can see that they don't do that and it's the bottom of their list yeah
i know some people have and acknowledgement is a big one that comes up
all the time yes no questions um uh what else comes up
yeah but that's the thing and so i wanted to know whether or not we 'cause at the moment you can get there's a method that will just give you the top five
for or the top x you give it any number and it will give you the top whatever for each person and then each
meeting knows about all the different dialogue acts for each person in the meeting and the amount that that occurred
and will give you that in top order as well or will give you or you can just search for each specific dialogue act
do you have to search on in b s and k s rather than real words right at the moment but
i can change that um so i don't know what we want to display that's what i m that's what i'm asking you really
all's a lot all's like twenty five
dialogue acts per b
yeah i think we should have the global top five that cause it each speaker's got top a top whatever and so just say one
of the boxes just explains does this is my top five dialogue acts for the speaker and then in the meeting you have
what you could either have the most commonly occurring ones or you could have a list of each speaker's top dialogue acts
either of those would do you but it would start take a lot of space if you have it
or you could have no you don't need that so you s 'cause it's 'cause it's a speaker window the speaker characterisation window comes up so you've got the global one there and then here you can just have the top five in this meeting and then then the top five in that meet in global the top five this meeting and then the rest is r obvious isn't it yeah
that occur
but you th some often the interesting ones don't occur things like joke don't occur very often well they do sometimes but they're not
that common one guy has top five joke one of them is joke he's an undergrad that's quite funny yeah yeah
it's interesting isn't it yeah he's the joker
yeah
yeah exactly yeah that'd be quite good wouldn't it
yeah
what percentage of the dialogue acts that he makes are jokes in the meeting and globally separately so once globally yeah
um i think most things are coded with a dialogue act a lot of them are coded with z which means no label so i just ignored that as well 'cause that's boring
and statement which is boring and also the other thing that they have is um if somebody quotes something so if i quote a joke
to you they separate that so they put they put the the dialogue act and then they put a double a colon and they put that aside just ignored anyth
any quoted material 'cause it's got nothing to do with i just scrapped it yeah yeah yeah somebody else's joke so yeah
you have to be original about your material otherwise we don't credit it to you
yeah yeah
yeah that's all done yeah all done yeah
um yeah i just have to i'll just finish there might be some polishing i can't remember but i think it's pretty much complete done so i'll do that tonight just put it up there so you can us start using that whenever
no i just well it's called meeting and speaker well i can judge it if you want
yeah
we could put it in a sep in a p package
if you can be bothered
well it doesn't seem to make any differ i've never ever used java packages doesn't even make any difference as long as in the same directory it works so sod it right
well then you can double click on and it oh oh no
yeah it will have something else just borrow a little microsoft gif like that

m b
where have i seen that before
yeah
yeah anything you like yeah
do you think we'd be doing uh m s c s in informatics if we did some people do yeah yeah
that's really easy you do it in um one of the w whatever the main is it you set w gif or some set f set set picture or something it's really simple
yeah i think you just give it a file name and it tells it it knows
yeah yeah it just sticks it in the corner yeah yeah yeah

yeah
it could even have some sound when it comes on it go welcome to the meeting browser no that's problem have to do it in the

not no but i think if you put headphones in it will just play just normally
yeah yeah
sometimes it works yeah
yeah
i still can't make it run t n t from java yeah you try it if you can make it work then i'll be well chuffed


it's a java course
course yeah
right
yeah i think it was
so what does yeah and it uh it's was apparently generated by going to d generate javadoc and it just went spat it all out and they never bothered to uh d comment anything
yeah at least get to know what methods are there so without having to look at the source codes yeah yeah
what
yes that's it right here
today wasn't it it's the eighth
okay
don't know maybe it's just a day i don't know
send him an email he'll probably re do it anyway so

yeah w
he said he might he would try
yeah

hmm

so how many people do we uh try and 'cause it
yeah yeah yeah
no it'll take forever and then you gotta analyse the results no no no no no forget it
yeah but one computer scientist one l and one dude off the street
yeah one man one woman yeah
yeah
two weeks two two two weeks today
yeah
when's the report hand in is oh right is that th is that the friday
the twenty fourth then
yeah
yeah yeah that's good friday
yeah


mm oh we should have it we should try and have at it done by then anyway i think otherwise it will start to getting b bit tight otherwise
we should aim to be finished by monday this monday coming a week no yeah well basically for tuesday start the evaluation t pretty much straight away and then get
get s yeah and then get um
we have to write the report yeah and everything we have to write everything
yeah

s p two
and you must have your research proposal is that in on the eighteenth shit i've not done at all yeah
hmm
yeah you have to start again it's just do topics instead of seg yeah you have to get the topics out instead of the segments uh yeah
to you're gonna be able to do a global search for topics
is that what you mean yeah yeah okay yeah yeah okay yeah i didn't think you'd bother with that but yeah cool i didn't think we're gonna bother with that but yeah yeah it does isn't it yeah

yeah
what with

well we'll certainly do it enough to make it so we can do some numerical analysis on the yeah but at at the very least
no exactly yeah uh
yeah no we won't be doing that well yeah even if even if i happen to manage to make it decent keywords i don't
think we can expect you to also come up with the search thing for it as well so
would yeah but if i collate yeah yeah if i create x m l files but if i m i'm not gonna do that
um i did have a look at trying to create x m l files it did look like a quite a a
mission really i suppose it's not it's it's as straightforward as writing in x m l files but it's but it's organising the segment
data though it would just looks so complicated to get it from
the um from a plain text file back into organise it by who which speaker speaks what
and how n doing the segment i think that was the stupidest way they could ever have organised the whole thing if you ask me but
organise it by time not by speaker but yeah but
so i don't know really what we're gonna do about that

yeah we don't do we need another meeting this week
mm
mm
wanna go today
ooh


yeah seems slippery


what day is it
okay
summary
um no no just the summary no that was just summary no um no um okay
oh write the sum okay right
yeah okay
i did i was trying to i didn't have privileges to get in to update your file i w i actually meant to i meant to send the email and then i was just c didn't get around to it
yeah i had yeah 'cause i forget mine as well and it's just like you know every time put something in there um so yeah i was
j yeah that was the main thing so um as soon as that's in it'll be right out i was making a couple of little change as well so so those will be
able to play with still working on the um trying to get the topics and summary search implemented as well
so that's that's sorta tonight as well so um yeah other than that
it's sorta coming along um getting a better feel for all these nite objects
it's just i don't know it seems a little chaos i don't know it's just it's um i don't know it's it's like if you're gonna use
this stuff later on in your life then you t spend the time to invest and learn all about them but it's like okay wow what's the minimum i can get away with
that that will get me what we need so it's like i don't know unless i wanna do something with this in the future
yeah right yeah mm i don't know anyways so um yeah that's my bad
i th
i think i yeah i i saw that and i'm just trying to remember if i did create it 'cause i think i was 'cause i was trying some stuff uh a couple weeks ago uh so that may be mine um
oh really okay
oh yeah okay okay yeah 'cause i saw it again today and i was just won was that me yeah i think that was me i think so um but yeah i'll yeah that was that was and sure
no g
give you false impressions of what's hap s something's going on
yeah i know it tons tons all those objects yeah

right how's our quota on that what's what do actually do you know how much we have yeah okay
so we probably won't have to worry about that yeah yeah
okay
yeah exac exactly
um i don't know how's everything else going
oh yeah actually
do we wanna keep that like are we keeping that how that happens it just prints everything out in the in the shell as well like as it does everything it just kinda i guess that's its default behaviour anyway so it's just kinda doesn't really do anything so okay
oh right
yeah
'kay right
yeah
yeah i was more or less just playing with the things that had to do directly with what i was doing so i didn't didn't take it for a full test drive yet but uh i can do that that's well right after this yeah
a lot of this java stuff isn't though
mm hmm
if you if you ch if you change your window manager it might look a little bit nicer just yeah oh yeah okay right
yeah
yeah actually can we run it on windows
oh yeah okay
were you using like a gui builder or just all from code
okay and that's
that's nasty
oh yeah wow okay
hmm
well well can you can you connect to your home machine from here and then start it from there just yeah i
don't know i've done stuff like that before it's insane it's insane yeah yeah
yeah
mm
right
what was it
well it's kinda boring yeah exactly
hmm
right
oh yeah cool
okay right or i don't know if we have like uh a choice so they can filter those out f the the top most common just say okay all show all or show you know only the im interesting ones
yeah
yeah i don't know yeah it doesn't really matter well if we just automatically filter these out
they're boring
mm
right
yeah
okay actually yeah this is good for browsing though it's perfect i mean that's sorta exactly what you wanna do and look at these things and so yeah who's doing what
exactly it's fun
right yeah let's take 'em to the next joke yeah
hmm right okay yeah well it's not a real joke anyways
yeah
okay that sounds real so that's sort of implemented now or is that or is it close wow super okay like to test that
mm actually
yeah and when i update my n l just uh recompile the m browsers and then just uh
get that yeah well so it'll use as my part as well my um the m search it
w actually do we have like naming convention for s our sorts files just prefix 'em with an m and
or
yeah yeah well that's sorta what i was doing it like for your stuff do you have no
oh okay alright
it doesn't really ma no it doesn't matter at this point no i was just kinda curious i'm thinking about future stuff maybe if
yeah that's true too
yeah yeah doesn't matter
yeah exactly 'cause
yeah
okay


oh yeah yeah
hmm
mm yeah right

yeah i know yeah same here
oh right
super size meeting browser well it's i don't know
um
just probably basic just text font and just something nice something solid maybe be a good
yeah exactly
i know anybody have any um artistic talent no no ok
yeah oh it's possib some people are balanced some people are no i know some balanced people no maybe i'll check see if i can find anyone um
okay
how do you s add that to the to the java programme is it just basic little okay uh huh yeah
oh
so just in the main frame okay okay right
right okay
oh so it'll do the automatic scrunching down if it's bigger oh cool nice super

they know it's a distincting di distinctive experience i guess yeah


can we g
can we get sound on these machines yeah i wish actually have you ever managed n oh yeah you must have yeah got play any sort of music on the dice machines right okay
oh right right they have them on the front too i think yeah
mm okay right
right

damn
yes yeah get a lot of audio no okay um okay well this this looks good
yeah
are we gonna be uh trying to get the output from that and i don't know still haven't found out if it's um
feasible to open up more than one well as many mm nom objects as we can for each meeting to do like we
were gonna need like figure that the ranking did make sense like to be looking through the highest ranked ones first
so if we are gonna look through only five of them just pick the top five to to do the the search and since that's probably
what we're looking for anyways so
yeah
are you serious maybe i'll try yeah okay s yeah i'd that'd be a surprise 'cause i'm bad at java yes um
yeah seriously
mm yeah practical java
yeah how do you guys find the documentation for n x t and
yeah okay good that's my belief as well
yeah
yeah yeah

yeah exactly well it's still i guess research platform uh
yeah
yeah that's true okay i was just curious well


so c did we have a date for when we actually want the system done i
thought i thought we said th i thought we ch yeah i thought we change it to the tenth or something um
'cause the thing is i mean we can keep working on little things f you know and sh oh well we should do this or do this should we um
so i don't know do we want to set an actual hard deadline for like did when exactly were we gonna start the evaluation
mm 'kay well we yeah i guess well we can still come up with like test cases or whatever for for the people and just yeah come up with scenarios
that sort of thing i mean that's that's fairly straight forward and could actually be fun
yeah exactly that's true just brain storm yeah yeah
yeah that's true yeah
yeah
right
to work on it as well yeah no i've i've got my d n l g presentation on monday i have to read the paper yeah
mm hmm
yeah i think so
we'll probably have to talk to steve at some point as well i guess but um
i'll probably just have a regular tuesday meeting with him like we can send him an email but i don't know if he's around even he's not around this week is he or that's why i think that's why we didn't have the the meeting
yeah 'kay
yeah it's true although do we really want the answer s s so if we don't ask we can push it off and
yeah
yeah yeah yeah that's
you're right yeah we're looking for volunteers
yeah
yeah if they have time it's hard finding people
yeah yeah i know but
yeah yeah that's true yeah that's true yeah yeah
yeah actually some other friends of mine in different programmes might might be more willing have more of a break
so that might be an idea get a range of types of people as well like not like highly computer lit like not you know
linux literate or yeah i think that might be good as well set a wider range
of people
uh no i think like three or four maybe bet that would be a good yeah i think that d no
that's that's a lot no yeah exactly like the thing like did an h c i course
a while ago and it's just that's what these yeah there's three people yeah and that was fine then
you can do a massive amount of analysis on three people yeah yeah oh yeah s
we don't want to
yeah exact exact
mm visible minorities yeah
three or four oh god um but yeah if he finds them then that's cool if he finds
the people m um
oh writing up
looks brilliant
okay
um i thought the evaluation maybe for the report so th and that's due on the twenty fifth twenty fifth is is it i is it that's what i understood
i thought it said twen i thought he said twenty fifth even though it's good friday i thought okay
yeah oh yeah easter two days yeah no well it
wasn't originally either so um yeah okay okay
so that gives us two days to do the uh evaluation no evaluation i was gonna say and report
i didn't think so necessarily i wouldn't i wouldn't assume but we should ask him
yeah that's probably c like it's a good target it's a good yeah
mm right
yeah
actually it's fun no no it's it just funny that you know have it finish by monday 'cause after monday i'm pretty much free for about a week or so it's like it's like if we had you know a bit more time yeah
okay
oh the next one okay see i'm yeah i'm free this after this monday and it's well why what else uh that's that's easy compared to the other stuff i mean i'm not even worried about that yeah yeah okay yeah okay
oh
you didn't know that oh yeah how's yours
thank god
okay maybe that was us then not him no actually i might have this stuff here
schedule yeah thursday twenty fourth
deadline for submission of final report
oh well now you can yeah
so twenty fourth so it we sh
yep um just to ask whether we need to have the evaluation done for the demonstration or
we should have it done anyways but okay yeah sure
hopefully but yeah is is that is that a part of the demonstration did they want that information the evaluation as part of yep
right
oh right

um there are a f a few little things um just made some comments the last meeting just general like how it all integrates blah blah blah all this kind of stuff but yeah
no i'd expect somewhere ten to fifteen pages
although it's fifty percent of the mark i think is it i think
yeah
exactly well we have a bit of time to do the writing up
so that'll be good
yeah just a fine tuned or detailed and yeah
more stuff

yeah that could be yeah that could easily be five or six pages
okay

sure
oh yeah sure yeah no no big rush
although just to get it out of the way so i'll try and remember to do that to my own s
yeah
yeah
yep
just basic um pretty much like the interim do you wanna do you have the interim stuff just um sorta like google type thing and just um oh
yeah yeah
then as these come up it'll just pop 'em in there
it doesn't do anything yet s like that's that's the other big part i mean how to get that that communication between the two different kinds of windows
because the thing is if we have different things in here like transcripts versus summaries versus topics um that was why it was sorta deciding to get the three panes in there instead of just the one um
yeah so so there's a couple of those little things as we yeah exact it's beautiful yeah m m makes more sense
okay is that how it works in the other ones in like the other windows like the various like um if we're in the topic or
if you have like a particular w window that you want me to mimic its behaviour then like just find it in the programme and just say okay just how this one does it so if it's like the topic window or the whatever
so then i can just sorta trace back and figure out what objects they are and bring 'em into here so
hmm
okay

okay
right
okay
so one left click just highlights is that
oh just the item in
the transcript or whatever it is
the
if even if we could just
yeah that should be possible
right
oh yeah
although yeah this this will uh this is actually different from how we print it up here like if we're doing a global search then we are gonna do it like how
we said before and pop up a list of the various meetings that found those terms and then we'll either you know multi select
or you know choose the one we wanna actually do this wi i think multi select would make the most sense well just um
if there's like three of the top meetings like like we said before language we're looking for the l word language and get the highest rated ones
to actually look for the terms we're not loading it on a val of seventy six i mean or seventy five whatever it is um
so the r the results from that will you know narrow down what we're gonna use for the local search
then we'll just do the local search on those ones that are chosen and if we can yeah so it it will be a bit
different from from how that is right now when when we do the global search at least yep
yes yes exactly yep
okay

hmm
um so that we search two different
right yeah that's actually fairly
you know local anyways yeah no that's easy sure yep that's that's quite t straight forward
yeah
mm hmm
yeah


yeah exactly
well it it kinda makes sense it would be kinda cool
actually are we bothering with our topic stuff still or is that sorta gone like our own topic segment like since we can't do the labelling and all the rest we are still doing our topic segment well you are you are i guess
okay but we're not gonna be we won't be l doing a global search on the topics for our topics
since they don't have labels probably okay la label all the label ones i'll open 'em
yeah all the label twos yeah i don't know okay mm
yeah okay yeah okay well no it will be kind of straight forward like if you're creating if you're creating x m l files of this
yeah
hmm

hmm
yeah
yep
right
mm
mm hmm
hmm probably not i mean just get work done i think that's what i've gotta do
yeah

mm hmm
sorry
yep
okay

yep
'kay it can be okay that's okay with me
further

oops
why's it not working f eight right
okay
mm why's it in the right
yeah it's connecting
okay
yeah actually mm some of my points might overlap with what william's just mention but basically
my method was like uh whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting just a couple of valuable points and started developing
on that and there might be some missing loops in this thing which i think we'll uh
take a feedback from the marketing because
um i haven't had some marketing data and basically every product is marketable so purpose
as william already said i would put it to simplify the interaction with t v to make make it as simple as possible and
to summarise i i would say it's it should be user friendly by being easy to use
rather than having a lot of complex button because you can have an engineering maybe having hundred buttons and maybe having uh a remote control which has the main features
like volume control or channel ch changing the channel or whatever
but we are to to make it unique so that people want to buy it will this two features
together so what the concept is to have a flip top model the main functions such as which are like often
used will be on the top and the complex functions which say you you can say like the y young generation
or trendy generation want to pr say programme their favourite channels or whatever can be put in the middle part
of the f flip top so it's like it could be accessed by a wide ra range of uh audience
and we can punch in new f features such as uh added features such as shock proof body and maybe a design to appeal to
a lot of people
findings most people prefer us user friendly rather than complex remote controls because there are times like uh people have
used a remote control for say a year or something and they they are not used maybe thirty to forty percent of the buttons
so it's not of no use of punching in the uh trying to put in those things in on the top of the remote control and try to confuse the user
as we saw we we have to make a profit also so we we can maybe go for an economies of a higher production
mm by fifty million we said yeah with that i think we'll be able to achieve economies of scale also so we can
give in add in more features and make it less costly
um
that's so this is if you ask me personally i would make uh
flip top with a trendy uh uh design and s maybe we we should look at also like the buttons whe whether they are like soft or little hard because they are times when the buttons tend to be a bit hard after uh continuous use usage and all that so in overall a simple and uh
user friendly design
uh any comments like if you want
okay
i think you'll have to
you can't
it'll have to this can't be pulled
you'll have to push it a bit more
yep
yeah this is more than enough
okay
yeah i think you can pull it out now

yeah
'kay
that's fine
okay
mm hmm
anything about that on the market research or something like regarding whether people want a combined something like that
ten perc
mm hmm
okay
pens
mm hmm
okay
so are we talking of a single model or maybe five six designs
sure
alright
right
the features could be same and the body could look slightly different
so
yeah


yeah uh maybe to as uh it it was indicated that uh uh risk uh of uh repeated use the injuries maybe a touch screen could be a better option for that
so a bigger b okay so y you're dividing designs based on not only segment age groups you're desi uh dividing
it according to the countries also the market maybe for u s and all you can have a slightly bigger remote
control and maybe in japan and all you need to have a small yeah
mm hmm
we could focus on the biggest market
if say people between age group of twenty to thirty five are the biggest market
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm

right i think it will be too much of an effort for a person to for a phone maybe he might walk down the street but for a remote he will just refer to the manual and all that
simple
mm hmm
mm hmm
so are we talking of a concept of a rechargeable something on the remote
mm hmm
right
mm hmm
okay
what i was thinking of a design which nokia h uh came up with almost six or seven years back basically
we have a flat one it it looks like a box like a chocolate that's very strenuous because your thumb is slightly up
so they came up with something like this curled up so here and you don't have to you don't bend your thumb too much
so it's like uh you can say a banana shape kind of thing curled up like a boat
g uh so what happens is you don't have to press your thumb too down like
so it's already curled up so your thumb doesn't y yeah so we can have a s like you know moulded according to your
the way you h hold of it's kind of semi circular in the bottom something like that
i wouldn't say exactly semi circular but yeah smooth
current
mm hmm mm hmm
we could look in at that but
mm what we were talking is to make it more
rather than like sea shells logo could become as you could put a logo in the corner of uh the model rather than you know trying to make it like a sea shell or whatever you were ta telling like
a sea shell
yeah we could look in at that
yeah maybe we could come at some say five six des designs and then choose which are whichever appeals the most like that could be the most common design
but we can like think of five six designs
mm hmm
yeah
yeah
for detection right
yep i think
true
oops we should f
i think it's time for us to
get back to
help
it's up there that screen's black
alright okay okay that's fine
are we done
right okay um this is our second meeting and i might be a bit all over the place um right our agenda for today do you want us to give you a second
okay um
i'll go over what we decided last meeting
um
we decided upon a universal control one handset for all t v video
equipment um that it was important that the product was accessible to a wide range
of consumers wide age range not limiting anyone we decided it was important
to reflect the company's image in our product we put fashion in electronics you know that kind of
s thing um our budget would have to affect um
try not to reflect our budget um that we might
have a bit of oh oh you can see it okay um dissonance between what our budget was and what we want it to look like um
want it to look uncluttered undaunting to the customer we discussed a flip open design um reducing the size of the control and an electronic panel um for further features like programming things like that
okay um three presentations i've got written here so
shall we hear from marketing first
no that's fine that's fine
unplug me
um f n
function f eight


mm hmm
they are
okay thank you very much um would you like to continue on from that
or maybe move the laptop over

f function
oh there
'kay
um i think we'll chat about it at the end okay so if anyone wants to write something down that they want to bring up at the end um
ooh it's vibrating that's strange
oh god
right okay
we just do the best we can

yeah you might
ah
look at that
okay yeah
right um
we have new project requirements um
we're not going to be using teletext um apparently the consumers consider it outdated with the internet now um
our control is only going to be for t v it's not going to be a combined control
which limits you know all of the different things that it limits the cost for us but it
also makes it easier to understand for the consumer
it says for t v only so looks like it's just yeah i think maybe sky things like that might be incorporated into it but
i don't know what do you think it just said for t v only but i mean general t v controls do do video as well
i mean you bu well som you get com you get combined t v and videos don't you
mm
i think we assume that it's still got play and stop functions and programming
mm
hmm
mm hmm
yeah bu
we do have a budget limitation that we can't control ourselves so i think
when we can take a cheaper option which still does the same kinda thing um because it
is something i it needs to be the thing that you
use to find it needs to be something that you don't lose you were saying whistling maybe on
the t v you could put like a pack on the t v or something so you can't see the remote you go and press the button on top of the t v
and it beeps and you're like oh okay it's over there something like that but that's that sounds a lot cheaper to me
um the third thing was that we have to make sure the corporate image is very much incorporated into the handset um so we want logo we want um
fashionable trendy i mean what you were talking about with the marketing
um people paying more for it to look good
um we need to focus on that as well
yeah
mm
yeah
mm hmm
what about you were talking about the buttons um the controls that are coming out now have kind of big rubber buttons not tiny little one big rubber buttons but what about i mean 'cause we got to make it original
what about
um you know with the touch screen computers
yeah um so you it's like a little panel that you touch rather than a button which shouldn't wear out as much either not sure about the
you don't have to press it you just have to put your thumb onto it um think that might appeal i'm thinking
kind of japan i'm thinking uh young um office people
trendy kind of a thing
um but quite um easily labelled so that anyone can oh yeah that's obvious what that's for and it's not daunting to maybe the older generations um
were too big
mm
i think we have to design one product and then the company can take it wherever they want to uh in the sense that they can make it smaller or they can make it bigger or they can change the features slightly um
it's gonna be the same so we need to focus on just one thing not get bogged down in lots of different um possibilities um
or a speech recognition which is extremely expensive i think that's the only way that you kind of avoid
that kind of issue
we are we're talking about um
the type of company that we're working for as well that they want um it to be fashionable they want
it to be trendy and you wouldn't automatically assume associate that with the older generations
now with the baby boomers the older generations are actually larger they have a greater
population than us young people but i don't think we're focusing on that i think we are focusing on a sort of
mid range um
business kind of class type people
mm hmm
okay so the remote control functions um we've got the t v we've got the video now there's um
i can't remember what it's called the little code at the end of programme details yes
we could use that as an alternative to programming in times things like that is that i always found that really easy when i discovered it um
because you've got your general record anyway so if you there's a programme on you want to put record on
that's fine but if you do want to tape something in two days time and you're not sure if you're going to you put the number in
and it's just a number it's not a date it's not a time it's not a channel it's not when it finishes it's not anything
like that it's just a number
no
you've already got the numbers for typing in anyway
it is after um if you look in the newspaper t v guide or any t v guide there's a five
six digit number afterwards and that's the number you put in and it's recorded that
it's going to be on on tuesdays at ten o'clock on the seventeenth so you don't have to worry about
dates and you don't have to worry about times um and it has been around for quite a long time
no it's not um but i think if awareness was kind of brought to the forefront about that
mm
okay so
mm hmm

the functionality of it in the sense that you're sitting there you're pressing this button and your t v 's not doing it
taking your t v and your control and saying look this is what i'm doing it's not working what should i do
i think so um
instruction manuals but i mean they're there's customer service there will be a customer service
number thing that you can phone up and speak to and that way there's no call out charge
there's no extra t the person has to walk to a shop on the high street um
mm but we should focus on making the manual as user friendly as possible because a lot of them
are just tiny little writing and lots and lots of pages it does you just put it in the drawer until something
goes wrong and then you try and search through it so that should be something we think about um
what other functions we need i'm not sure if we need a design um decision now
but we should think about c 'cause you've got the dilemma between oh batteries
that's what i was thinking about mobile phone batteries what kinda battery is that
well they la they they last quite a long time and if you had uh when you th the
thing that you get with mobile house phones you sit it in its charger when you're not using it or t
at night or something but it doesn't really matter 'cause it never really runs out 'cause it lasts a long time once it is charged
um something like that should reduce the size of it
yeah it could be on that yeah okay
s
yes
rechargeable with a docking station
so the rechargeable which would be your
field
okay
yes which it is cheaper in the long run as well um th the shape you got
trendy i don't wanna big box with lots of things you don't want
a tiny sort of little thing either because then you have got the repetitive strain injury no matter how many
how much you try and make it simple um
they do
okay so we've got a flip screen
um
okay
'cause it's kind of moulded to your hand anyway
okay
can you look into the company logo
um things that are associated with the company in view to trying to incorporate that into the design of the product i mean
for example if it was a c or something like that you could have it in a vague c
shape that opens up kind of like a shell or something um
something along those lines to be able to incorporate it quite
um obviously into the design while also making it quite different from anything else that's there
well we need to think about how it's gonna look different
or you could do um different like you get with mobile phones different fascias
you could have different kind of casings so you could have like psychedelic ones for
younger people and sleek ones and
yeah
mm
okay
okay
okay
right i think we have to round it up um
sure
that was um in cutting down the number that was kinda separate that was cutting down the number of functions making it simpler so instead of having lots of things you put in for date
it's kinda takes the place of having a button to press for the date and having the button to press for the channel things like that um it could be it c
it yes it could be uh adv advertisement feature um rather than design feature you know drawing attention to that
and it also paid um lip service in the instruction manual 'cause it's very simple so putting it down in words should be helpful
yeah
um
we've got the buttons but i think we'll work through that with the design of it um
yes yes
and we've talked about um there being an alarm or something a beeping for being lost um
learning how to use it should be as simple as possible but there aren't gonna be that func that many functions incorporated into it so it should be fine and the i the instruction manual i don't know if we deal with that um
i think
yep and different from what's out there yep i think that's us
i think you might get guidance but um
i th
instruction manuals 'cause there tends to be a
demonised thing u um they're everyone's got like a big pile of them but no one really uses them
um
yes right okay
right okay
i think you can email me if there's any more questions
um and i'll be able to not answer them



okay yeah i'll go first can i grab the
thanks
what do i have to press oh f eight
oh right yeah
okay
maybe
yep there we go
okay this is uh the working design presented by me the uh industrial designer extraordinaire
'kay this is where i went a bit mad with powerpoint so what the first thing
question i asked was what are we trying to design well a device which basically just sends the signal
to the t v to change its state whether that be the power or the channel um or the volume
everything is just um some sort of signal to change the state of the t v or
other appliance that it's sending the signal to
um so i decided i'd have a look at what th other people have designed and try and take some inspiration from that but uh although we will want to be taking
ideas from other people we wanna make sure that our design stands out and i thought that was something that well it wasn't really my area because
i'm dealing with the inside really so um yeah i ran out of time so i couldn't do this one as
fun as the last one um and uh i found out that most uh controls
use some form of infrared to send signals to the t v presumably because of the cost issue of
uh something like uh the same thing that computers use wireless and you don't need to send very much information
um most of them are powered by some form of battery now our one i'm i'm
not sure whether we want to look at the size issue because most of them are powered by triple a batteries
but those can be quite bulky so i d i didn't know if you wanted to look at something else um so we could
shrink down the size of the control yeah sure
um no no if you if you look at if you look at most remote controls they're quite they're quite chunky and that's because of the size
of the batteries they have to be obviously this certain size to fit those batteries in yeah
the the well you can you can get the sort of circular round ones but i'm just wondering about power consumption and how
much you need to send the data across um and d which leads sort of onto
the next point about 'em being small and easy to carry round um now the ones at the moment
are small but i was just wondering if we could look at something a bit smaller
now the main components i came up with um were obviously the power source for the batteries 'cause otherwise it's not gonna
work uh as i said about the w which batteries we were gonna choose we can
uh discuss that later and then you obviously need something to decode the information that you're putting in
from from the controller and to turn it into an i uh infrared signal
which we're going to use to send the information now these have a wireless range of up to about five metres
which is sort of suitable for anyone who's watching the t v unless they're in a cinema
which not most people do so as we're applying to the most audience that should be fine and then
i was uh just had a quick look at the external design but i d i left
that mostly to the uh interface designer
and so this is what i had as the basic idea of what we wanna do it's not a proper circuit
i'm not sure if it'd work or not i'm not even confident that those are the real um the real way you'd wire it up
but anyway we've just got the the power going to the infrared bulb with the chip and the
uh u i interface um
which would basically when you when you pressed anything it would the chip would convert it into some
form of i r data which could be decoded by the t v receiver which obviously means that we're gonna
have to conform to whatever
um whatever form of communication that the t v s are already using and since that that's
another use and reason to use that infrared because that's what all t v s use at the moment
and then finally um we want uh the it to be available to a wide
audience at a low cost so all the components that i've put forward are uh low
in cost so that that should be good um it should should be different enough
um from the alternative products to get a good consumer base we were talking about it before
and also just something that i was thinking about uh because they're small they're also easy to lose so if we could
look into some way of d dunno some anti going down the side of the sofa
thing that you could have i th that was just sort of a general point there
and that's uh yeah
alright okay and yeah that's that's what i came up with there so if you wanna
ooh
function f eight yeah
no no yeah it's just
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah sure
there we go i've got a bit more of the cable
there we go
uh you should be able to and yeah there you go

okay
huh
t yeah yeah
i d well i dunno 'cause uh the w if you've g
yeah if yeah and if you got if you got a sky box they have one of those plus boxes you can record straight off the t v anyway so on to on to like the t v hard drive or so
yeah
yeah
ju um just as an idea on the uh speech recognition thing that pr it'd probably be quite expensive to incorporate an entire speech recognition thing and they're not that great anyway
alright okay
alright okay
yeah
yeah but um on on that again i just thought 'cause you can get those key chains now and you whistle and then it'll let off a loud noise to let you know where it is so i thought that could be quite a
yeah yeah
yeah
hmm yeah
yeah
well y yeah you could you could have a number of different designs i mean inside they'd be essentially exactly the same
just yeah yeah
'kay
yeah yeah that's what i was just yeah
no well no 'cause you wouldn't have to you don't actually have to press them you just
yeah
yeah
mm but also er ergonomics as we're saying with the different designs ergonomics uh
there's sort of physically different things 'cause um if you've ever seen the x box
they had to make two different sized controllers because people in japan wouldn't buy it because the controller was
physically to big because um
they're c uh just generally japanese people have smaller hands so they couldn't get round the controller which
is uh so if you i don't know what 'cause you obviously you
can have bigger buttons for some countries or something and smaller ones for others
yeah yeah
yeah
hmm
huh
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
i yeah i was just thinking about how you could combat that 'cause without without doing something where you have to move your arm around to change the channel and it becomes yeah
yeah speech recognition but yeah
mm
ge uh
yeah
video plus
yeah yeah
just whack in the number
and you w yeah and you wouldn't you wouldn't need uh a whole host of extra buttons for that you just need one 'cause you've already got all the numbers there anyway yeah

it's not
yeah
it's been been around for a long time it's just it's not very well advertised as to how to use it and things
mm though if y if you've got something like sky anyway you can just click on it you can just press the button on the programme once and it'll record that programme when it's on and you press it on it twice and it'll record the whole series
so that yeah but just to have that function would be would be really good
yeah
mm but the only problem is that with a mobile phone you signed for a contract so they
um the companies who uh who you deal with have actually they've they've
got an obligation to to help you out and also i mean it's it's fair enough
to have some sort of help service but i i'm not sure how much the cost would be
of having

yeah i mean
i mean instru instruction books i feel c i reckon can cover that
yeah
department yeah
yeah
and they're yeah they should be f yeah
yeah
yeah
it's the uh yeah
um they're they're specially made for the for the mobile phones but they come with a charger i mean you could you could bundle a charger in with it but
mm hmm
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah and if yeah if you if you had if you had one of those uh just coming back to your other point about pressing the button and setting off the bleeper in the room that could uh
yeah on that as well so
yeah some sort of docking station or yeah
yeah yeah th yeah that that'd be fine and also that would mean they wouldn't have to go out buying batteries all the time
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
mm
yeah
mm
yeah
yeah
yeah
okay

oh god
uh no that's okay sorry
um is it okay if i postpone that til later i just want to get access to a little bit more information is that okay
mm hmm could i can i interject to ask a question there is that appropriate you're saying the triple a batteries are small or the surrounding it
mm hmm
right the triple a s are the smallest you can get are they not right
oh i see
okay
mm
mm
mm that's a very important part it came up in our market research findings too so i can refer to that whenever you like me to present
no
the plug hasn't come out at the bottom has it no
meter adjusting
mm
'kay
have i got to keep this here does it matter
i'll have t i'll have to move it won't i uh whoops will it manage bit more oh dear
oh
is that okay
thank you just pull it closer a little bit
get it right over okay thank you
okay um i'm going to look at the functional requirements from the marketing point of view
and uh obviously our starting point with marketing is always market research um
so that's where we started we used our our usability lab the company's usability lab we did our usual selection methods
to get a cross section of the general public male and female all age groups from fifteen upwards and um we
observed them in the lab just their general use of the remote control you can see we had a hundred subjects there
our findings lots of findings i've just summarised some of them here the overall thing which i've i've got at the
top there in italics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls so it has obvious design implications
there um we found that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly
eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy we were quite surprised by that finding
but um that's quite a high proportion of our our you know international target group are prepared to spend more money
for something that's a bit nicer looking um current remote controls do not match well with the operating
behaviour of the user overall for example you can see below there seventy five percent of users zap a lot
so you've got your person sunk back in the sofa channel hopping so again there's power implications there
um fifty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons so again a big design issue there um
and possibly we can also cut back on cost if we don't have so many functions actually on the remote control
um
the biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were um something that you you mentioned earlier
uh remote controls are often lost in the room it's a slipping down the back of the sofa type of thing uh fifty percent
were were particularly frustrated by that uh thirty four percent of people take said they take too much time
to learn to use and i think that ties in with the um the previous finding of people only using ten percent
of the buttons they just can't be bothered to learn about the other functions
um um slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for uh repetitive strain
injury you know those small movements of the remote control can lead to kind of shoulder and elbow problems
um the vast majority of the thirty five and under age group would like um a liquid crystal display
and speech recognition again that was to aid i think in uh when they've lost the actual
remote control some kind of speech recognition something we didn't put to them but which i'm thinking of now is um
even if perhaps the lost control can give off a bleep every now and again til you find it or a flashing light possibly
um that trend reverses in the older age groups so thirty fives and unders who would like those two features that kind of evens
out thirty five to forty five and in the older age group it kind of reverses they're not so bothered with this
i had marvellous tables and things that i could show you but i think i'll just keep it simple if there's any more information i can email you extra details is that okay
mm hmm so can we not programme a video with this remote control
just channel hopping
would that imply video use
mm hmm yes
yes
um we didn't really look into that but remember we found that finding that most people only use about
uh ten percent of the buttons i think th th those do tend to be the basic channel hopping things and on and
off for the video fast forwarding so on and i think it's sort of general knowledge that people do find programming their
videos a nightmare so i don't know if that's something we need to look at
mm hmm
in fact i've just called up that table there we asked those two questions the table relates to both questions so we didn't differentiate
would you prefer an l c d screen that's multi function remote and would you pay more for speech recognition in a remote
control so you can see how the the yes no sort of varies across the age group there and a substantial
number of don't knows in the older age group i think that's just general fear of new technology
oh yeah
right
mm
yes
that's a super idea
yeah
yes further market research will be needed to kind of focus on what that is it's gonna be different for a fifteen year old th for somebody
who's sixty and also across the world if we're aiming at the international market what is um attractive to a trendy
new yorker and what is attractive to a retired south african i dunno you get the idea
it's it's gonna vary around the world at the end of the day th the engineering design is one thing it's the user
interface design that may and th the sort of you know fashionable aspect of it we might have to change
for different markets round the world
yeah
mm
mm mm hmm
yes it will appeal to sections of the market def
mm hmm
mm hmm mm
mm hmm
mm hmm
th the internal d engineering design has got to remain the same yes absolutely
mm hmm
mm hmm
i'm concerned when you read the the r s i issue again repetitive strain injury i don't think just moving your finger
around on a small screen is going to deal with that enough i think that is still a kind of a question mark issue how we deal with that
um r s i tends to be caused by repetitive small movements
i'm j i really can't get my head round this one this may have to be postponed to a future meeting but it's something we should think about
mm
i know and it becomes ridiculous yes i know
yeah
yes
mm hmm
do we have to initially um you know looking at the findings here focus on
a younger age group initially and then broaden out the market later do we really have to go for everyone right away um
mm
and when we've been throwing up our ideas we're automatically talking about business people young people trendy people

mm
mm hmm
mm
mm i'm just thinking of budgetary issues too for when it does get to the sort of broad scale marketing stage we want to you know not waste money not be profligate and uh
you know focus on where the idea will be taken up first it's most likely to be taken up first of all where the main purchasing power is coming from for a product like this
mm
right i've not come across that function but it sounds wonderful
ah hmm
right
superb
mm
yes
right
excellent mm hmm
mm
right
can i just run this past you while it occurs to me i don't mean to quickly jump from one subject to another but just discussing the different
age groups and targeting the different age groups it occurs to me to produce our own mobile phones that that's kind of what
led us on to comparing t v remote controls with with their design features um chain companies
like carphone warehouse you can pop in anytime with a phone that you bought for them w if you've got any problems with it and they'll fix it they'll phone the company
you can use their telephones is it worthwhile with with our retail outlets
having a a similar um kind of service so that if older users were deterred from buying this if they know they can just
pop into one of our high street outlets th you know which button is it i press for this th as free as a free aspect
of our service would that not make it more attractive to them
mm mm hmm
right
alright
yes
if it was something as simple as you couldn't change the channel but i mean for if there were any more or are we absolutely definite it's only gonna be for t v and video we're not gonna put any okay just a thought
okay
mm hmm
sure
mm
yeah
not for such simple functions because we're focusing on that yes okay
mm
puts people off reading them so they just do the obvious yes
sure okay
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm
and we don't w i mean so many remote controls look absolutely identical these long brown things with the same coloured buttons
all crammed in on the s the surface we definitely an ob an obvious thing a very simple thing is to get away from these brown
rectangles we don't want that
mm hmm
slightly curved curved
mm
mm

i mean look at the mobile
i think that's that sounds a really attractive idea i've not come across anything like that before if it kind
of yeah and that opens out into your flip top then it's nice t to h you can make it lightweight plastic nice to hold in the palm
of the hand and just because you're having to actually insert in between the two covers that's gonna take care of some of the
repetitive strain injury trying p prevent a lot of that i would think i think it's a really nice idea and plus
you can get you know even though we're using plastic you can still i mean think of the designs you can get in plastic we can do a nice conch shell
or scallop shell exterior
mm hmm
yeah
mm hmm
less chance of it being lost too it's not like a chocolate brown lozenge that's gonna go down the sofa and people might want to put it on their mantelpiece
or whatever as a ki if it looks attractive enough as a kind of ornament they don't not gonna lose it so much either
it's easier to bit nice to handle
mm hmm
okay
can i just quickly um go over the new project requirements so that i haven't missed anything so it's no teletext it's only for t v and by implication video our corporate image should be incorporated in the remote control um something about videoplus
right
right
right so when they press for programming you it comes up on the l c d a reminder about using videoplus so that they have a look at the guide and
or was is this nothing to do with the project requirements is this just that was an add on feature
uh huh
right
right so it's kind of doing away with the programming feature right
mm and the rechargeable batteries was there anything else there that we in the new new project requirements
mm hmm that's not at the moment a requirement it's something we're looking at what preference so it may come round to market research at some point to see what people would like
okay
what would you specifically like marketing to look at before the next meeting or shall i just sort of generally look at all the issues involved
okay
okay
whoops questionnaire four
'cause we're at lunchtime now i think
okay is everybody ready
mm hmm
um i take it you all have received instructions as to what you were supposed to do and um
i think the marketing manager probably should go first addressing the needs and desires
yeah mm hmm

okay
you're participant four
okay and now i can uh full screen
uh okay okay

uh okay can can i at this point interject um something um we have received
instruction from higher up that certain things should not be uh considered um
the one thing for example something to eliminate maybe that's the teletext because that's sort of outdated
with the internet and according to to higher management
the it should only control the t v mostly because they feel that it's too comp
complex a task to um to to include other things and they are concerned
with the time to market
okay um and the and the third thing that they wanna make sure um that their
that the corporate image is being maintained and that the corporate colour and design are being used on the product
so that it's easy that that that they can be easily identified as a product of of
of the company and that there's no mistake that it could be somebody else who is bringing this out so
i just wanted to interject this here so we're not getting too much off track here with uh with the things we wanna look at
these were instructions from higher up so we have to eliminate uh these things so it's only gonna be t v
but the one thing maybe that could be um eliminated is the teletext uh idea
mm 'kay
okay
and uh
who would be next uh i guess that would be you mm hmm you want me to get your slide show up mm hmm
and you are number three number two
okay
okay
mm hmm
yep
yeah yeah uh huh
there mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
yo and it's yeah but it's so
yep
yeah well yeah well that has been e that has been eliminated so that's that's unfortunately a moot point now mm hmm

yeah i
it just build a mould basically and uh you know
as the budget we're looking at if you build one mould i don't think that's going to make a big difference whether it's gonna be square or
oh yes
i think i think we will have to look at the budget on that but i think in principle that that would be that would be kind of fun you know
yeah
silly for children
like an animal or
yeah

yeah a little elderly a little arthritic hand you know and and it's a small button and and it they don't press it exactly you know something else happens n not their favourite channel comes up but something else and they're very frustrated you know
mm mm hmm

mm hmm mm hmm yes
yes yeah you're sitting there already or maybe you have no other uh
mm hmm
yeah mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah
holder yeah mm hmm
mm hmm
okay
well you don't have to
this one
and francine
you are number two
you're three
would you want it full full screen mm hmm okay
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
on the on on the remote yeah mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
right
mm hmm
yes
by your child mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
timer yeah mm hmm mm hmm
uh okay now i have
on my slide show basically we already we have already done the agenda and uh on the closing
uh basically there will be lunch break and all that however uh the decision we have to take
in this meeting is who is our target group and uh
what function working design how how does it work so these are the two things we should come
up wit with so uh the first thing is pro maybe a little easier on uh
who is our target group
um
i guess in many ways everybody
everybody who has a t v
yeah and i think today there are probably not many people who don't have a t v there are a few but in general not
now talking about the target group which is in a sense everybody but i think within the target group
we have subgroups we have we have earlier it was mentioned about um
for example elderly people who have limited function with their fingers and hands so i think that's
uh one group that's certainly important um then we have just the nervous
people who can never press a little button on anything um unless it's really very clear
and uh i don't know how much we want to cater to children's use
i mean that's a question um whether that's important that children can
really use it or not
so this these are just some thoughts i have on it and um i dunno what you feel about
whether we can just say we have one target group and for this one target group we're gonna design this one thing
or whether we're looking at what we like we we talking about different shapes whether that different shape also
includes maybe different uh buttons uh for
different groups
mm hmm
that has a lot of that has a lot of appeal but i think uh i'm i'm talking about the functionality
now on it whether we're looking at different groups i think the children issue can be addressed with the shape and with
colours you know like you make it nice and pink fluorescent banana colour or whatever
you know yeah for example you know but the question is really who is our target
group
do we look at one target group
and with the twenty five euros you know can we can we afford to have uh i'm asking the technical people here whether um to look at
sort of subgroups with maybe different buttons for each group how much would that throw us
out of the cost we are supposed to respect
right
with with
mm hmm
well that's that's
yeah
no
the the quest the question to be addressed here is only who is the target group and how will it function and
i think the how will it function is probably the question of the buttons you know within the target
group or subgroups the question is only whether our budget will allow to
have more than one design in a sense i mean the basic design i understand will be the same
but the question is how much will that set us back if let's say uh forty percent
we make large buttons and the rest we make regular buttons for example
so that remains to s to be seen but uh the target group as a whole is is basically everybody with a t v
yeah well that's that's the question
well maybe there's there's an idea you know t the new for example new portable phones they have
like removable plastic cases so you can have a striped one or you can have a fluorescent blue
one or whatever and maybe something like that that in each package you know you have
you you have you have for example uh you have let's say a fluorescent blue on
it but then you have uh another colour or stripe whatever that already comes in a package
and then if people really want more colours they can buy it separately
you know yes
that's right and but like if if then everybody is is is tired of the fluorescent blue and of the striped or whatever they have
as another one in the package then they can go to the store and for a few uh francs or euros whatever they can
buy an alternate package with another two colours in it you know for example you know
well i think i think the idea here is to uh to to d design one remote and what the only
change is gonna be um the funct d t yeah uh the functional
functional cosmetics if you want to put it that way um having maybe larger buttons or buttons
that light up or buttons that are slightly differently shaped for people uh either for children um
five minutes that was i guess tha that's the old message
finish meeting now um um
but i think i i think to sum it up the target group is basically everybody if money permits we can address some features for some subgroups within that
do we agree do we
do we agree on on that in principle like money will tell whether we will be able to do that or not
okay so now i understand it's lunch break
and um
so that's what we will do
so hank you very much
and we'll see you after lunch
yes
okay
okay
what features
s sellable yes
yes
okay
okay
receive
multi purpose
eliminated
mm hmm colours
yes exactly
yes


like a doll or
yes
yes
okay
something else
channels
yes
yes
mm yeah
yes
hmm
okay
to keep the remote yeah
a case holder a holder remote holder
participant two
yes no no i'm three
i can make it full yes yes yes okay as uh user interface designer
i did a little research to find out what are the features which a user would like to have on their remote
yeah can you please go onto the next slide so i found out that uh but uh the main
purpose of a remote is to uh f control the function of a television at a far
off distance at remote distance
now for that uh a remote controller should have a switch on off button by which a user can
sit anywhere in the room in front of the t v and he can control the functionalities different functionalities of the
t v there should be a signal uh something like a radio wave or a infrared light
or a led which can be used to change the different functionalities in the television if the user wants to uh
change the channels or increase the volume he can change it
now there should be some timer to set for viewing a particular a particular programme or switching on and off a uh a particular programme according to the user choice
yes yes
so if if he want to view a particular programme at say nine o'clock he can set the time and the
t v will automatically it will switch on at that particular time so he can use that kind of uh uh
properties of features and then there should be a child lock system if a particular channel is not
to be viewed by a particular uh for a certain age then the parents can lock that particular
channel so that the ch children cannot view that channel and uh the uh the
uh and the one of the feature a user would like to have is the compactness of the co remote
uh t the remote should be compact and it should ha it should have as many buttons as possible for controlling different
functionalities of the t v television and um uh as uh uh
this is my personal preference that it should be in the shape of a t in alphabet for more compactability
and uh and uh and it is one more point which i noted it down like uh the material
which which which is used for remotes should be human friendly it should not cause any skin disease or something some al allergy
to either children or to um ad adult person and it should have an uh it can have an alarm
clock a a person if some if somebody wants to get up at around eight eight p m then he can
set the time and it can be used as an alarm clock and i don't think it will cost much to set an alarm clock inside
a remote
yes and as john reece said the buttons can be uh can me
we can use the fluorescence to light up the buttons so different uh buttons will
glow differently so in even in the dark the user can know what buttons to use to switch
on a particular channel
and uh uh the design of the uh um remote should be in such a way that there should not be any sharp projections so that if a child plays with a remote he uh he should not be harmed in any way
and findings uh i found out uh y um on different sites that uh
there are different remotes which can be used there are remotes which use the infrared for controlling the different
functionalities there are remotes which use the radio waves to control the functions and there are
uh
so uh there you have different uh types of remotes for different light source which are used which can be used for controlling the different functionalities of a television
next slide
and these are my few personal preferences like it can be used for a multipurpose use not uh no
uh like it can it can be used as a t v control as plus an alarm clock to set an alarm a timing
and it should have a child lock and then to save electricity uh there should not be
uh much s move uh lots of circuits and all that and if a person if if
if parents wants the television to be switched off by ten o'clock then it should be switched off
ten o at ten o'clock automatically so that nobody else comes later and use it
timer yeah and then you can use a timer as well
yes
yeah that's it
okay
t v television we was
mm hmm


different colours
yes


okay no uh generally we can we can design a remote which is mainly for
people with uh f age from ten to um forty and and then we
can add on uh specific functional buttons for children as well as the elderly people or the people
wit with who have nervous problems yes
but in a family in a family there will be a aged person children and a middle aged but they cannot buy three different remotes they would like to buy just one and um just one which can be used all the three uh
cost effective
okay
yes
okay
um
yes
but uh yeah i i have a doubt like will it be cost wise effective if we if we design
a remote having all the uh different features for different people or designing
three different um remotes for three different categories of people
okay
of th okay
okay
mm hmm

okay mm hmm
yes
okay
yeah
mm
open
and then full screen
mm hmm
'kay
mm hmm
yeah
yeah
yeah
hmm hmm
mm
yeah
mm hmm
yeah
mm
yeah
mm mm hmm

mm hmm
complicated yeah of course
yeah
mm hmm

yeah
yeah 'kay
yeah yeah sure thank you
number two yeah
yeah exactly
uh can you make it uh full screen please
no it's like a well you you have to press here
the cup cup shape here the thir third
yeah exactly uh so today i'm going to talk about the working design of the remote controller um can you go to the next sli slide please
the metal is like uh in a remote controller you have a chip integrated circuit which is like a brain
of the remote controller it takes the power from a battery say a battery it it can be a elec an
electric supply like you have to uh like uh switch connec connect connect your remote controller to uh
power supply from the you know electricity or something like that it should be a battery because uh uh remote controller
should be like you you you should take it t to wherever you want and then um uh th this integrated
circuitry takes energy from the power source and whatever like if you press a button it's like a input
for the remote controller and it takes the input and it it transforms into a infro infrared bits
and it sends it into the device like a t v or a air conditioner something like that so
uh a remote controller is specifically designed to a single device if you want to design it for multiple devices then
you should make all the devices compatible with the frequency like uh th the remote controller it sends
some bits some uh waves like with a particular frequency the device should know what
the frequency is it should re re recognise the uh waves which are coming from the remote controller
and it should take the action like if you press a button channel or something like that then uh the remote uh remote controller
will send a send a se send a signal and the t v it should translate
that into like change the channel or something like that change the volume control and
uh so uh i think it's hard to design a remote controller for multiple uh devices
uh yeah

um
so uh user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages like there should be a user user in interface
like you know switch pad or something like that buttons should be there so uh you can control whatever you want you
want to change the channel you want to control the volume you you want to uh mute uh mute the uh t v or you want to have
a child lock or you want to do some operations there's a there should be some device to tell what to do to
the uh in uh integrated circuit so that the integrated circuit can s send the signals and t v
can perform the actions
so can you go to the next slide please
so i i just would like to uh add some extra features to the remote controller um i think these
are the very simple features and uh they don't take much uh uh much of the um um
investment also it's like el the text or buttons which uh which are there on the uh
remote controller they those we can make uh um like fluorescent uh they'll
be like light emitting if it is dark so that you can find your remote controller if it is dark
and ther there should be a beep if many buttons are pressed if suppose a child is playing with the remote
controller and a and she she or he is pressing the buttons all at the time then there should be a beep saying
that it's this this is not a a you know a a action there can be no action
taking to that so and there should be a child lock like uh uh you should be able to lock your remote
controller so that uh um whatever buttons are pressed by a child they can't be like y you i you if you have
ki kids and all then they'll be pl playing with the remote controllers so can lock the remote controller if
make it useable for more than one device it's a it's hard but i think it's possible but it uh yeah yeah
yeah so it's it's okay yeah yeah and uh different shapes that we can do like uh we
can have you know a all animals shapes or you know comfortable uh whi which can fit into your hands
and um so that uh
yeah yeah yeah and colours also different colours and
no no no it won't uh i don't think it will be like you can have you know for uh if you want ther there to be more
yeah yeah it's it's just a s shape so it doesn't matter
yeah
yeah that is also possible i uh yeah i i yeah
yeah that will be
yeah yeah
mm hmm
yeah for children yeah exactly yeah that's what yeah
yeah exactly yeah and and the butto buttons also i think if you want to have more features
in your remote controller then there should be more buttons if there are more buttons then it will be more complicated if you have
less features then your remote controller won't be attractive so i think uh we need to make some buttons which are
which are like um uh f in uh in intended for two or three operations like if you press
one button in one mode then it will change the channel if you press the other button in another mode it will change the colour
so if you want to have less buttons we can have that option but i think it will complicate the matter more i think so
yep yeah
mm hmm
yeah it's like you know yeah
yeah
yeah yeah
mm hmm
yeah
yeah yes
yeah yeah you don't us yeah yeah usually yeah
yeah shapes also different shapes yeah that will
mm hmm
yeah
yeah
yeah yeah and also text should be very clear so that there there won't be any ambiguities and uh
so yeah
and uh display clock i if you want more features then we can display a clock it i i don't think it will take any money extra money because anyway we have an integrated circuit i think we can just definitely fit that feature into the circuit so it's
yeah and we display a clock
yeah
yeah and then you can just see your remote controller yeah yeah yeah so
yeah
yeah uh can you go to the next slide please uh components uh the main components we need
for uh it ha like buttons and uh underneath that there should be switch and uh
bulbs like uh we can have a bulb like whenever we are operating a remote controller or uh
whenever the t v is on suppose then the remote controller should automatically have a b
s light
then it will be like if you switch on your t v through anoth another source not from through a remote remote controller
and you you lost your remote controller maybe you can find with the light maybe we can have that whenever
the t v is on remote controller will have a light
and then uh infrared bulbs um this is like uh when it is dark
and battery there should be a battery for power supply and a chip chip which is like a brain to the remote controller which does all the operations and wires connecting all chips which is uh lights everything so there should be wires
and uh uh of course there should be a case where we can keep all the things and you know different shapes or whatever it is there should be a case to put to give a shape yeah
yeah holder
um uh can you move onto the next slide
um next sli slide please
um i have referred the site uh the homepage of the um our website uh from where i have uh uh i got s few points
that's it that's it from me now
um
uh it's not like that i have referred the page to get new ideas or like what can be the working design to how it works and all and so and so
yeah if you want
yeah it's okay
uh it's actually there now there on the screen
mm
yeah sure if there is a clock then there can be a alarm clock
hmm
it's like a t okay it's like a timer it's like a lock to the television
mm t v yeah
don't t v yeah
hmm
yeah
mm
yeah
mm hmm
mm
yeah
yeah
mm
we can design different remotes for different people like for aged people there will be big buttons and you know yeah
children and everybody yeah
yeah of course that we can do but specifically if y if like elderly people want big buttons then you
can't really make a bi big remote controller so maybe specifically you can design a big con remote controller
for elderly and for children like in a different you know
no it it doesn't cost yeah
yeah doesn't doesn't doesn't matter
yeah

hmm hmm
uh no mm i i i don't think no it's not
hmm
yeah like for mobile phones we have uh different you know covers like designs and all so that w we can have that
yeah
yeah but uh
yeah

yeah maybe yeah yeah if we do some more research maybe we
hmm yeah i think maybe seventy percent is a unique uh uh remote controller and thirty percent is yeah it's sort of like yeah
yeah yeah of course yeah
mm hmm
thank you
yeah i'd to just put on my microphone here and i'll be right with you
okay
okay you want me to start right now
okay well could you um put my slides up 'cause i think it might be helpful if uh we looked at the slides at the same time
i'm participant four i believe yes uh huh
'kay
there we go okay well i think we have introduced ourselves so the functional requirements are is is part of my goal but why don't we pass right to the second slide
cause that's where m my discussion starts right well um since i'm in charge of trying to figure out
what we should put on this thing since i have to try to sell it um i thought that the method
i should follow would be gather suggestions from everybody and th the reason i just put that there like
that is that uh in the init in the initial stage i think i should just be open to
lots of suggestions you know you can say anything you want no matter how silly it sounds you know it should run your car it should heat up
your motor if should um turn on your c d whatever you want it to do um and then as
we go on what we'll have to do is accept and eliminate these suggestions according to um
design and budget feasibility
so i'll be coming to you um frequently as the industrial expert to tell me how hard it's gonna
be to add a feature or how expensive it's gonna be or if your time if it takes five years to develop
this it's just something we can't do so in the beginning just have a big puddle of things that we anybody
can th throw anything in and then just weed things out that can't be done for one reason or another and then the things that seem
the most attractive that to uh to a customer we'll try to then prioritise
those so that was um what i meant there and as i said on the slide there consulting
the industrial engineer about that and the other thing is timing is really gonna be as important as money because if
we're gonna sell this thing i think the best time to sell it is as a christmas present
twenty five euros makes a nice little present and we want it to be an impulse purchase we want somebody to see it and
think it's gee i just gotta have that and take out their wallet and buy it so it's gotta be really attractive
and it but it's gotta go to market by september 'cause anything that you don't already have out there in september showing it around
isn't gonna sell for christmas um and then i'll be coming to you as the user interface person
to try to tell me from your point of view what are the most friendly features that
we could put on it and try to prior help me with that prioritising of
uh of the features and of the the look and the colour and i'll be coming back to
you to help weed out those suggestions from that point of view
so i'll be coming to you for how much is it gonna cost us and how long is it gonna take you and i'll be coming to you to
tell me what's gonna make somebody take out their wallet you know what what's what's gonna really be
what they call a sizzle 'cause we gotta sell this sizzle a lot of times the thing that
works the best from an engineering point of view isn't the thing that somebody's really just gonna take out their wallet and buy
for christmas for for their child or for their husband or whatever okay can we go to the next slide please
alright i i already did a little bit of research after our first meeting where we threw out some ideas and it looks to me that within
the budget that we're looking at the uh the whole house idea really isn't gonna be possible so i'd like your
suggestions to come back to the other slide where i was saying we we could suggest anything i'd like the suggestions to be really
specific so that we'll have a list of things we can cross off not something like you know whole house control
what'll be and then i found on the internet from from my research that some extended
electronic entertainment control should be possible at the budget that we're looking at and at the price point we're looking at
we should be able to make it work the t v the v c r the stereo set um maybe something else
cute like a coffee pot or one other appliance or maybe a lamp i have to wind up
yeah sure
okay
okay

of course yeah
okay so that's something
okay so
okay
alright thanks for that um alright now other things that i found out on in my research
is that the complaints that people have about the remote controls that are out there now 'cause a lot of them take too much time
to learn how to use and that was thirty four percent but even more important the thing that we did address
in our last meeting that frequently it's lost somewhere in the room um so those are two things that we
definitely do wanna address uh we wanna s make it as simple as possible we wanna make it um
obvious and intuitive to use and then the
things about finding it we talked about the a light emitting thing as well as uh
maybe a beep and i think that those are things after my research that we definitely wanna
try to incorporate 'kay can we go to the next slide please
okay so my personal preferences in this um project are really have to
concentrate on the sizzle that is the selling point the thing that's gonna make it an impulse purchase uh
because once there's no be back well in sales they always say you know be backs don't come back if somebody
says oh i'll come back and get it next week you're dead they're never gonna come back and buy it you've gotta make it attractive enough so they buy it
now now now w now is a big word in in my book for selling this thing
and in order to make it really sellable we've gotta shorten the learning curve make sure it's really intuitive
and easy to use we have to have as few buttons as possible because more buttons
is more confusion so that's why i'm saying simplicity is good finding it's important obviously you can't use it if you can't find it
so we've gotta concentrate on the features that help you find it and i've already said this several times but i put it down
in writing here it should be an attractive impulse purchase at twenty five euros so it has to have enough value that when
somebody looks at it they say uh twenty five euros i'm not gonna take that has to be so great that they're gonna say uh
twenty five euros isn't much um and then maybe a motto like we put fashion in electronics
might be something we can use in our marketing campaign okay that's uh about it for me right now

okay
mm hmm
signal
mm hmm
yeah well that's already been eliminated by management so we're off the hook
mm okay
okay
mm hmm
mm hmm
well we already eliminated that
now that's good from a marketing point of view the fun the fun shape and that you you say that won't add too much to the budget to d the shape is uh
do you think there's any chance of um having ser in having basically the same machine with the same buttons but maybe several different shapes
is that gonna be a possible 'cause that might help with the marketing
because we had something sort of sexy for adults and we could have something sort of silly for children or a little animal shape or in a or a little elephant so they can remember where it is
mm
well i think i think that that's something that we'll have to discuss um with the user interface person because i think there's
a lot of argument to be made for one button for one feature because i think one of the things were complaining
about in my what i found out in my research is when they complained about how hard it is to learn a new one the changing
modes was something i mean you and i all f all four of us we work with computers all the time changing modes is
nothing for us but people who
n and
and that's and that's the kind of thing people learn by feel and um you don't feel
the mode change so um maybe having buttons be various shapes might be a
help too you know like the a triangle is for the volume and a square is for changing
channels so that people can uh develop a tactile sense of it but we'll get to that with you
that's right yeah now that's a good point yeah
yeah that's that's a good that's a good one because the clock would be really friendly and and when is your favourite show coming on and
yeah and a lot of time there's not a clock on the screen and you have to go somewhere but you just wanna look at the news for a minute yeah that's that's good the clock is good okay
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
case
so it um we should visit this site and have a look at uh what's up there or
okay
okay so it might be helpful if we had a look at that
okay thank you
could you go back to that slide where she had that uh s slide up betsy
yeah okay thank you

mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm 'kay
and an alarm clock yeah that should that should be okay
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
well you know there's the old motto children under six never shop alone so if you've designed something that's very
attractive to children um the mummy please mummy please um you know we want it
now we wanna go to the store and see it um that has uh a lot of marketing pull
mm hmm
that's right
you can make a banana shaped one
mm hmm
respect mm
what about the electronics that's not really gonna change much is it
that that w that won't change much will it uh
i d i wouldn't think so
mm hmm
yeah
yeah
yeah
that's right and can we can we is it even feasible to make one one remote control
with something for everyone or would we have to use the same electronics and make three different shapes
um the same electronics and basically all that's gonna be different is the plastic case and in that case we could probabl
moulded plastic isn't all that expensive is it um you as an industrial person
mm hmm
yeah
mm hmm
well there's a real idea yeah
mm hmm
yeah
right
mm hmm
uh yeah
an alternate package
yeah okay
well i think we can only aff yeah
cosmetic
warning finish meeting now
well we may have to come back to one or two of these points at our next meeting but um
mm hmm
okay but we have to l
okay fair enough
okay
hmm hmm hmm
yeah
okay yep yep
okay
tu tu tu tu
hi good morning
'kay

oops
mm
oh sorry
mm hmm
yeah me
cat
where did this come from
uh yep thank you uh maybe you can guess what i'm trying to make
yep
it's actually sitting so it's sitting it's not standing okay i see it as one thing it's very supportive
it's your best friend and your you can talk to a dog it can be your best friend it doesn't discriminate between you based on what
you are second it's loyal and third thing
it's got intuition dogs can som sometimes can make out between
a thief and a person so basically these are the three unique features i think belong to a
dog thank you
okay
sorry
does it look like a dog actually
mm

eagle okay
one point four or something like that one point four euro would make a pound or something like that
yeah
okay pretty huge margin
so then
mm hmm
yeah that c
okay you wanna integrate everything into one like
okay
so simplification of symbols you could think of
mm hmm
menu alright
uh uh
right i was thinking on the same lines you instead of having too many b buttons and make it complicated for the user
may h maybe have an l c d di display or something like that like a mobile yeah and with menus and if it's s
somewhat similar to what you have on mobile phone people might find it easier to browse and navigate also maybe
you mean to save it lesser number
right
mm hmm
okay
mm okay
s
it might it might save a b bit of space it's i instead of looking bulky it might look small but it might have its cost implications
right
okay
mm yeah

are we we're not allowed to dim the lights so people can see that a bit better
okay that's fine
am i supposed to be standing up there
okay
yeah i've got
yes

okay hello everybody um i'm sarah the project manager and this is our first meeting surprisingly enough okay this is our agenda um
we will do some stuff get to know each other a bit better to feel more comfortable with each other
um then we'll go do tool training talk about the project plan
discuss our own ideas and everything um and we've got twenty five minutes to do that
as far as i can understand
now we're developing a remote control which you probably already know um we want it to be original
something that's uh people haven't thought of that's not out in the shops um trendy appealing to
a wide market but you know not a hunk of metal and user friendly
grannies to kids maybe even pooches should be able to use it okay
um first is the functional design um this is where we all go off and do our individual work um
what needs need to be fulfilled by the product um what effects the product has to have
and how it's actually going to do that um conceptual design
what we're thinking how it's gonna go and then the detailed design how we're actually gonna put it into practice and make it work
okay right we're gonna practice with the pens and draw our favourite animal
on the white board i'll go first and um sum up the characteristics of that animal
so
okay i'll leave space for everyone else um
what's missing
we're running out of blue
okay i'm not gonna ask you to guess i'm going to tell you that's supposed to be a tiger
and i see them as majestic
and independent
and
proud
now who would like to go next 'kay
is that your lapel then there you go

okay thank you

okay
well as you can see the quality of the work today is um

gonna be a bird
is it gonna be it's gonna be a bird


that's lovely
okay it's fine

technical help
hmm
okay yeah
a seagu right not a seagull
eagle

mm hmm

that's lovely

okay
that was fun right um finance wise we've got a selling price at twenty five euros which i don't actually know what that is in pounds at all any ideas
d fifteen seventeen okay that's expensive
i think so i think so i'll be able to um pull it up or i could put it in the shared folder or something
really
mm
i think
yeah um production cost's at twelve fifty so
half of the selling price is taken up by building it um and profit aim is fifty million euros which is uh
yi yes um yeah i presume so um
mm hmm
no yeah
so yes yes i don't think we have to i don't think it's a case of worrying about
different languages and things like that um making that a key point just that it's going to be in the international
market like australia america things like that okay
what are your experiences with remote controls i mean i've got we got um
we had three videos a t v and a sort of amp thing all set up
so we got one of the universal remote controls um that you programme each of your things into
but that kept losing the signals so we'd have to re programme it every now and again i think it was quite a cheapie as well
so that might have had something to do with it but that was quite good the fact that you could
you didn't have six remote controls sitting in front of you
mm
yeah the main that's the main stuff anyway i mean and you don't want to i hate i hate
looking at a control and seeing a million tiny little buttons with tiny little words saying what they all
do and just sitting there searching for the teletext button or something like that
yeah
um
when they're when you've got the main things on the front of it and a section opens up
or something to the other functions where you can do sound or options kind of
recording things like that inside it 'cause it doesn't make when you pick it up it doesn't make it really complicated to look at
it's obvious what you're doing um
what about the older generation what about granny and grandads
um my grandad can answer his mobile phone but he couldn't even dream of texting or something like that
i don't think they tape things i don't think they use
mm yeah the age gap
mm
i don't know i d i don't like the you know the new phones that have kind of got a windows based running system
i find it really confusing i kept getting lost in the phone i di i've not got a new one but uh my friend got a new one and i was trying to do things with it and i just kept getting lost but
that's just me
yeah
teletext has got that option as well
yeah
or what about kind of a dual function in that you've got the basic buttons
just for your play volume programme things and also and then a menu
to go into with obvious pictures obvious symbols and that's where you control
recording and things like that
mm hmm
i think that's a cost thing i don't i don't know how much we're gonna know about
yes no that's important
okay
mm
yeah
um right okay we've got half an hour before the next meeting so we're all gonna go off and do our individual things um
i think that's probably about it and then we'll come back and liaise again and i get to do another fantastic powerpoint presentation
sure
okay
mm
i would it would probably
i mean there's sky remote controls and everything they're kind of moulded and look a bit different and the telewest remote controls
are silver plastic which looks a bit smarter so yeah i guess that's stuff we can
think about okay so let's break it up there
okay so see you in half an hour
i think so yeah
it's sitting down
yeah i'll have a go
thanks
alright okay well since you guys have chosen the ones i wanted to do i'll have to have to go for something a bit random
and also my drawing skill isn't that great so yeah
okay now i'm gonna have to change what is was originally gonna be because that looks like a beak now so
yeah it can be a crocodile it can be a crocodile well it was it was an at first firstly it was
an attempt at a t rex and then it sort of changed into a pelican but it can be a crocodile now actually
yeah and uh i'll have to think on the spot of uh things that it is um
uh scary
uh strong
yeah that's about it i think
uh uh
wo

hmm
okay
uh
s
uh

okay some sort of bird
ah eagle right okay
they're good at golf
yeah no yeah an eagle

it's about mm mm yeah
yeah yeah something like that so that yeah about seventeen seventeen pounds something like that
but
havi having said that though if you wanna get one of those the the ones on the market at the moment they're s they're about twenty pounds anyway so it'd still be yeah we had to buy one
hmm
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah uh
use all the ones at the same time
yeah 'cause you
yeah
mm
yeah
yeah
yeah my grandad's actually better than me at using teletext so
yeah
yeah what it just needs to be as long as it's sort of self intuitive and you can can work out
what everything's doing 'cause i mean menus on sort of new phones now they've sort of got all these pictures and stuff which makes it fairly obvious what you're trying to do
but i don't know how
oh yeah
yeah i don't i don't know how for twenty fi or twelve euros fifty how much of a excellent screen you could get you'd you'd have to sort of keep it down to a black and white l c d thing anyway i'd assume
y
yeah
no uh uh
yeah just just a quick thing about the
um about what you're saying about the uh does does it need to be fashionable the sort of i
i had a quick look at the company website and it's like the the uh we put the fashion into
electronics so i think think the whole design thing might be qui i mean you don't
you you can still have plastic and it'd look quite good but
yeah
yeah yeah
okay
so we've got both of these clipped on
she gonna answer me or not
right both of them okay
god
jesus it's gonna fall off


a kind of dog
sorry
uh
mm hmm
please please leave me a space at the bottom i'm little you can get to the top with standing on a chair

i think it's outstandingly good
crocodile

o

beauti that's
okay
um i'm very impressed with your artistic skills mine's are dreadful oops this is now coming apart let me just put the top in
i hope that clicks in i'll just i'll hold it on okay
oops oh dear what happened there
hopefully that'll stay on two handed version okay uh
again this is off the top of my head i was gonna do a big cat too um
oh dear it doesn't look what like what i want it to be
uh
it's not a vampire bat honestly
uh and somewhere there's a body behind that's my dreadful that's
the worst yet that's it's meant to be an eagle you can tell it's a flying animal could
have been a seagull i never thought of a seagull an eagle um again i'm thinking on my feet goodness
i suppose they're all so independent i'd put that one down again da dum
um
indepen independent right did you say they're good at golf are they oh
oh right okay i'm not good at golf i'd say they're quite free spirited flying around everywhere
doing their own thing
and uh birds of prey aren't they oh dear intrepid i'll put that intrepid
there we go hope that pen's gonna be okay
whoops
seventeen
seventeen pounds
should we be making notes of this we can just refer to this later can't we yeah okay
okay
right
so
so i suppose later it depends if we want to undercut the price we d or or is it going to make our product look a cheapie cheapie option
mm
mm hmm
in our first year
mm hmm
you've got market range international and you did say earlier it's got to be a um accessible and usable by sort of all age groups just t we're not focusing on business market any particular thing it's everyone user friendly to everyone okay
big target group
no
mm
alright
mm hmm
right
mm hmm my experience has only been being given the remote control with the object i buy not doing any
tampering with it and programming using it to programme t v and uh uh videos and things but basically on off volume
up and down channel one two th that basic functions i don't think i could go any further with it
than that so i suppose it's got to be something usable by someone like me as well
mm hmm
mm
mm and symbols that you don't necessarily understand symbols you're meant to understand that you don't
oh yeah
mm hmm
mm
mm hmm
actually that just raises a point i wonder what our design people think but you know on a mobile phone you can press
a key and it gives you a menu it's got a menu display i wonder if incorporating that into the design of a remote control
might be useful so you've got a little l c d display
with menus yeah yeah
yeah
mm hmm mm hmm can he programme his remote control or is it basic with that too
right
right
so that's a problem regardless of of any design modifications you you come up with that's gonna be a problem anyway with the older generation perhaps and that's another issue how we tackle that
mm hmm
right

mm hmm
is it possible that that for the older generation you could have like an extra button that you press for large print like you do in large print books obviously it displays less on the screen it displays less on the screen but as long as they can read it that's the main thing
mm hmm
yeah
mm hmm
mm the other thing is just ch chucking into mobile phone f design features again it could have a flip top remote control so that when you flip over the top your screen is you can have a bigger screen in the the flip over
yeah
mm hmm
yeah like smaller
and there's no reason we need to make it look as fashionable and stylish as a mobile phone it can still be lightweight plastic you know something that's easily moulded and produced sorry i'm treading on your territory guys
ah right
okay
sure b y yeah
but yeah i mean it doesn't have to be that you know th that was my main point we don't have to use metal i don't know if using plastic does make it cheaper i presume it would yeah yeah yeah
right
okay
'kay
do we go back to our room yep
okay everybody ready uh i think the first thing we do is introduce ourselves
and everybody's name and what your function is so maybe we start with you
mm hmm
mm hmm okay
mm hmm and your name is
okay
very good and as you already know i am betty i am the project manager for today so why don't we look at the presentation to see what we really are supposed to do
um
yes y opening acquaintance tool training well the tools are i think we already i guess the tool is really our the computer as far as i can see
uh we get ins each of us will get instructions and we'll take it from there project plan that falls under the same heading pretty much um i don't think we have any great discussion at this point um
here is what this thing should be this thing we are gonna um uh design is a new remote control uh should be original trendy and of course user friendly
so maybe you wanna make some notes of that
okay
all right here is what the functional design is supposed to achieve um
that is it's gonna be individual work and then at the meeting we'll discuss what uh we have come up with the same goes for the conceptual design there will be individual work whic and then discussion afterwards
detailed design same thing basically
mm hmm mm hmm
i can't write with this thing
yes
yeah okay all right
then tool training try out the white board participant can draw their favourite animal does anybody want to go and see how the white board works so that in case we have to in the next meeting present something on the white board
you wanna go eileen and
whether you without hanging yourself
and remember you have to press so it works mm hmm
fat a fat cat

okay
and you're francine right would you like s like just to see um how it feels so that you have a little idea
in
no no no that's okay
i don't know we'll get to that later
okay okay

here's the project finance uh which of course we all have to think about when we design this thing um selling price is supposed to be twenty five euro
uh profit aim for the company is fifty million euro the market range unlimited meaning international
and the production cost should not exceed hopefully should be less than twelve fifty euro
mm hmm
so these are all things of course to remember with the budget and when you design to materials cost etcetera
now uh the discussion i guess is um does anyone of you have experience with remote control
i exp i s 'cause we we use 'em we use 'em right everyday and um
now having used a remote control for years does anybody already have like an idea like things you didn't like with it things you would like to change things you would like to improve with this thing ye any first ideas
would you like it to be smaller bigger have more have more buttons on it or maybe clearly better marked buttons you know things like that
small right mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
so it should be a multi functional uh gadget that would um control all your household uh uh machines basically
well
it should be something new it should be s it it should do something different than than just what we have now of course the other thing to think there is maybe the design
like trendy no like f for earlier we saw maybe it should be something trendy you know maybe it should different colours or materials or you know um so yeah shapes right you know like kidney shape feels better in your hand or something you know
yeah
yes
that is true because they put a newspaper or they put it behind a plant or we you know whatever and and they suddenly the phone rings and they want to turn the t v off and they say where the hell is my my remote control yeah
well or yeah or if it's really if it's really in a dark spot that it gives out a a sound or a signal yeah mm hmm so if lost
if lost uh signal with b throw signal you know
exactly i mean just that's what i'm saying i'm just saying throw signal meaning just whether it's a beep or whether a light or
okay my my idea is maybe that the minute it's really hidden in in other words if it's like
in a dark spot uh meaning you know like a newspaper is on top a sweater is on top or
it it's behind a plant at that moment it's it's like it's like um what you call it a light s
sensors you know in in that moment it has a sensor i it it gets a certain darkness it ge
has a sensor and it gives out a signal whether that be a light signal or a beep i mean that we can discuss that later
you know
that's right you know there would be right you have to have some kind of sensor and i i think uh voice
or clapping it's not specific enough uh i know there are the lamps and stuff you know you can clap on
and off but i think they only work to certain degree and
what with
oh yeah well but then those people we can't help everybody
okay we have uh yeah we have to move along but i think we have some good good points to start with here
okay the next meeting will be in thirty minutes i think you all did you get uh notices on your computer for
this okay so well you got the notice um uh the working design
i guess that's the function i d uh who is this the industrial designer that's you
okay so we looking for a working design when we come back

then
and then the technical funct you are the technical function so so you are the working design so you have a working design
and then a functional design and the marketing manager is coming up with
some user requirement specification like friendliness and what we just discussed in general
that would be your idea and of course price that it that it that the price is
a good price i mean the price is given but that was
that's right
that's right
and you know specifi you you will get specific um instructions for that i think that's the end of the show yeah
so um we have well we have a twen two two two three minutes um any questions at this point or uh suggestions
i think basically basically you will get instructions to work with and if you have any questions uh uh i guess you can uh
mm hmm
mm hmm
okay
then uh we see you in about thirty minutes and see what we can come up with
okay
okay yeah my name is francina and i'm uh an user interface my role is uh the main responsibility is user interface and my role is to design uh a television remote control


yes i'm francina yes sure
no okay
what should i draw
i'm going to draw a snake
how does it look like

yes
yeah i
yes i i feel that all the remote should be very compact yeah those which we get here
nowadays it's very long and um and it should have multi purpose like uh the
remote control which we use for t v it shou uh it should be used f uh for some other purpose also like
controlling the uh temperature inside the house or for air conditioners or for heating
system
yes exactly
yes
yes
yeah exactly

yeah
yeah design should be yeah it should be different all the almost all the remotes
yes exactly
are different shapes yes
yes

or a b
should ha
a fluorescent signal yeah
yes
yeah and uh
yes
then in that case
yes
okay

okay
yes
yes
okay yes
yeah
yeah uh i'm jeanne oui um uh my role is industrial designer and my responsibilities
are uh uh um deal with the technical functional designs and
specifications of user interface and dealing with user interface design



snake





yeah of course using remote control yeah
uh
yeah yeah
audio player oh okay
hmm
divides us yeah yeah

yeah
yeah of course
yeah maybe ten i do yeah colours and al shapes also yeah
yeah of course yeah
yeah

yeah some beep or something like that so that we can go
yeah
yeah maybe it should have a light so that we can we can just recognise where it is yeah yeah
may not be beep
beep or uh it's a light maybe it's a light
yeah probably yeah probably it's a yeah yeah
mm hmm
yeah of course that didn't
i i we can't do it

yeah good point
me yeah
yeah
yeah it's functional de yeah exactly technical
yeah
uh working design yeah it's it's uh mainly technical functional design
yeah functional design and you
yeah
yeah even i have yeah even i have i think yeah
yeah so let's see
hmm
yeah
okay
i think so
yeah that's a good plan
and i'm a marketing person i wanna figure out how to sell them
my name is eileen
okay
mm hmm
no
mm hmm


okay
mm hmm
mm 'kay so
three different types of design that we're gonna be concerned with okay
functional conception
and detailed
maybe we should redesign it
after we've finished the remote control we'll get to that
okay i'll see what i can do see if i r
see if i remember how to draw a kitty cat or a rabbit or something

so that it will record okay um uh um traditional kitty cat
i've a very fat cat and it likes to sit like that okay
am i supposed to wipe off that or okay
okay
uh okay
i hope the kitty cat is hungry 'cause i don't like snakes
mm hmm

okay
mm 'kay that should keep everybody on their toes and challenged
profit
um is fifty mm
oops
at um twelve fifty euros per
well who knows if we get a really good designer maybe we can do that
we certainly can try to i agree with her that to market something successfully it should do some more things
that's right
yeah okay friendly shape that would help i think another thing that would help is um if it beeps when you clap because i think one of the big things that happens is people lose them they can't find it

mm hmm
so some
uh so so it's really the beep or or a light should blink
mm 'kay
and do you think a good c c um clue for that is that it would respond to a clap or it would respond to your voice or it would respond what what should you have to do to make it beep or blink
mm hmm
mm hmm
okay so
okay
so the light sensor would activate the signal
mm hmm
but it could be someplace really obvious and you still wouldn't be able to find it
well because you're s because you're silly because people are silly
i mean it could be on well i if it were like on top of your bookcase and you usually kept it on the coffee table um you know well maybe we have to move along okay
mm hmm
we have to justify that price by having sufficient features to make it sell at that price
mm
okay i think i have enough to think about 'til our next meeting how about you people really okay
'kay
alright well uh
okay very good
okay
hello everyone

um how uh how we doing
uh first we going uh over the minutes of the last meeting more or less
um in the last meeting uh the marketing manager had presented
uh her method of working meaning gathering i suggestions
from everyone to see how she best could market uh this this product at the within the budget uh that was given
uh in general the idea is that it should be something that is not difficult to use
um it's also an item that people lose a lot so we should address that and of course it should be something
s s that is very simple to use
in addition to that to make it sell of course uh the marketing manager w wishes that it be very attractive or like she says put some sizzle into it in one way or another
so that the people are buying it now because in particular with smaller items that's a very important fact 'cause um if they say well i go home and think about it that won't work
um also mentioned was it should be uh it should have a very short learning curve
and maybe it could be sold by using a slogan
our technical manager has then said that she feels it should have a chip
that has infra red bits and it has an interface controls w interface that controls the chip
therefore messages uh will be controlled in the same manner there should be extra features like lid buttons maybe a beep if too many buttons are pressed
mm uh uh child lock um and uh maybe a display clock so that people could um
you could see the time you know what show they want to watch also mentioned was uh maybe different shapes
so the components of the thing should be button bulbs infra infra red bulbs battery chips wires and maybe some kind of a holder
uh for the for the uh item
francino who is our um interface designer
um uh has mentioned that the that it of course
should have an on off button and also has mentioned an interesting feature that it should have maybe a channel lock
particularly with maybe small children that they couldn't uh watch a channel that is undesirable it should be compact
her personal favourite was it should be t shaped and maybe have an anar alarm clock
and the material should possibly be not of non allergic nature
uh the different systems uh that exist are infra red or radio waves
uh maybe it should have uh electri electrici electricity saving feature
and even possibly a timer to so that people can program their favourite uh uh program on th right from the remote
uh are we all in agreement that that's about what we discussed last time okay
okay then we i'm looking for three presentations and uh i don't know whether the order matters much uh i don't i don't think so so whoever w wants yeah okay
okay your slides okay
oh come on close already
and that's number two right
three
okay
nine what nine channel uh switches
nine channel switches is yeah mm hmm mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm

mm hmm
mm hmm



mm hmm
mm hmm
right
mm hmm
okay thank you very much uh any comments on uh her presentation
yeah i i th i think
no i think the these are her presentations but uh as far as the decision making we getting to that after after but if i just wanted to know whether anybody had any any anything to add to her presentation
mm right
mm hmm ho who wants to go next um
mm hmm okay and you
uh okay
oops
the components design mm hmm okay
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
go away
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm mm hmm
mm hmm mm hmm
mm hmm
okay and you have more pictures uh we have five minutes to the end of the meeting
okay well thank you
any particular comments by anybody
we don't have a lot of time left and we will still have to make a decision and the marketing expert has to present her her thing
uh okay
okay uh that
concludes the presentation of everyone and what we really have to decide in this meeting is um the concept of the remote
and uh so what do we think on the concept
of the remote

y
okay mm hmm
i think that's
mm hmm
well you you teach you have to teach uh
okay before we get too far off here um the components of the concept is the energy what kind of energy do we foresee
battery battery
okay then chip on print
okay and the case and i think we all agree on the case we wanna have something uh maybe bright colourful
mm hmm
trendy design compact and strong
user interface concept uh interface type supplements
that will be your area i think right jana
put uh k i guess uh for yeah
and
not sure what they mean by supplements
oh like
oh
a what right right right mm hmm
right
okay uh our next meeting will be in thirty minutes and the
uh i d is to this is the individual actions to be taken until then
to have the look and feel design
and uh the u i d is supposed to uh come up with the user interface design
and the marketing expert with the product evaluation in this phase the two
of you jana and francine have to work together on a prototype using modelling clay
it says here you will receive specific instructions will be sent
to you by your coaches
um if you have any questions you know you you can always uh contact me um or uh or your coach i suppose

um so um i think we conclude the meeting here and we come back in uh uh thirty minutes according to our timetable here
thank you very much
hi
mm hmm
interface designer
yes
yes
okay i can start first
okay
now my slide please
three
participant three
yes
okay
now as an interface designer i would give more emphasis on the interface how the remote looks like so that it is sellable it is attractive to customers
next please
okay now the function of a remote is to send messages to the television this messages
could be uh switch on off message or switch to next channel message or swapping
the channels or switching onto a particular channel like you can have the numbers one two three four
up to nine
pardon me
yes nine numbers
and then you have swapping of uh button by which using which you can swap the channels if you don't want to see the third channel you can swap it to the fourth channel or vice versa
then it should have a next button and next button channel by which you can keep on uh v uh mm eh scrolling the channels one by one next slide please
then you should have a button which should which ca which can be used for increasing or decreasing the volume
then there should be a button which can give subtitles for a particular program which is going on a television
for example if you are watching a french program and you would like to have a subtitles in english
then there should be a channel which can trigger this mechanism in the television so that the user can see
uh the the subtitles on the screen
then there should d uh there should be some buttons which can control features like the colour colour of the picture the contrast sharpness brightness of the picture
now there should be a memory switch
there should be a mute button suddenly if if if uh uh viewer he gets a telephone call
and if he want he doesn't want to switch off the uh t v but he he can reduce the sound he can
bring the volume down and he can watch he can uh while talking he can watch the t v now
the most important feature i would like to have in my remote would be the speech recognition feature
it's an integrated progra programmable sample sensor speaker unit
so a remote can be th can be uh designed which can have the voice recognisers you can record your own voice
which can be recognised by as voice recogniser in the television for example if you want to see
we if you want to see the ninth channel if you say just say ninth channel uh th now
the the uh yeah the remote will automatically it will switch to the ninth channel so the t v
will have some recogniser which will recognise the user's voice and accordingly it will change its functionalities
so this is one of the very important feature a remote control can have
so this is one one of the interface which can be created
a very simple interface which has all the t uh uh important features
then please next slide
then these are some of the remotes which are different in shape and colour but they have many buttons
so uh sometimes the user finds it very difficult to recognise which button is for what function and all that so
you can you can design an interface which is very simple and which is user friendly even a kid can use
that so can you go on t t uh to the next slide
yeah so this is one of the interface or one of the remote which has this vi voice recogniser and this has multi purpose use it can be used for t v it can be used for cable satellite it can be used for v c r d v d s and audio
and this has in built voice recogniser
can you go on to the next slide yeah now this is an interface for a chil uh for a remote uh uh
which a child can use uh this is user friendly it's very attractive and uh children
can use it as well as they can play with it and this comes with different colours different shapes
and this this uh child uh interface has minimum buttons and all the important uh buttons are there in this small compact
attractive child interface
next slide please now this is a big over sized remote which cannot be misplaced or it's impossible to misplace this

so this is no this is a very big you cannot misplace it anywhere so this is a jumbo universal remote control and it's impossible to im misplace or lose
this i this is one such interface which can be created
and the personal preference uh would be a spe uh uh to incorporate speech recognisers uh which will respond to user's voice for a particular uh function
thank you that's
mm yes
okay
okay

we can
it works
mm yes
mm hmm
mm hmm
transmit
okay
okay
push buttons
'kay
mm hmm
uh yes i would like to include this feature which is called as voice recogniser
this could be uh one feature which could be sellable
mm hmm
no it's it's uh yeah it it's like your recording of uh all uh um a question already
and then you're expecting an answer from th for example you have a t v system i'm the user and my family
members are the user i will already record uh a question like uh good morning
like around eight o'clock i want to see the news in the television so i'll say just good morning and the t v will switch
on it will recognise my voice and will switch on
battery
yes
yes
and compact
trendy design and compact
yes
push buttons
and
supplements like different types of features buttons like can have a f mute button or a swapping button
recogniser yes
yes
okay

okay


okay
thank you
hi
yeah good
hmm
yeah
going to the nex next
mm

mm hmm

yeah maybe
participant two
uh the next one sorry it's it was the old one
components
um this time i'm i'm going to um concentrate more on the components and the technical side of the remote controller design uh can you go on to the next slide please
i have just brief uh down few uh components which we require for the remote control uh construction uh the first one is case to keep all the components like integrated circuit battery etcetera etcetera it's like
uh it can be a plastic one hard plastic so that it can be strong even if you
just uh uh you know if you if it falls down then it doesn't break so it should be strong
and uh uh there are no harmful materials used in that and it should be recyclable
uh and uh yeah and also uh using of colouring compon components like uh if we want to have different colours blue red green so uh uh we have to use uh some colouring compone compone components
and uh the second important thing is uh uh uh integrated circuit uh
which uh we can use a highly sophisticated one because it's like the it's like the heart of the remote controller if it is not
efficient then everything wi is going to be uh like um the lef ess less efficient so it you should we should
have a highly sophisticated one and it should be resistant to high as well as uh low temperatures
suppose if it is thirty eight degrees outside forty degrees outside it should it should uh be able to re uh resist
the uh temperature uh uh highs and uh high temperatures and low temperatures
and uh it should be with uh um equipped with timer and alarm facility
and the uh other component we should uh we have in the remote controller is a resistor uh
which is like uh uh i it is very very much important for the electricity uh flow through
through through the uh remote controller and uh also a capacitor which is a b which is a m i think it's it's like
a battery capacitor can you go on to the next slide please
uh a diode a transistor a resonator these are all this uh technical uh electri
electronic compons uh components which are which we have to use in a remote controller a battery uh i would like
to suggest one thing uh if we
uh if we will be able to make a res rechargeable battery then we sh we need not go
for a high performance battery even if it is a low performance battery it ca it can't l it can't charge
much it it it's not a high voltage battery then also we can if it is a rechargeable one then uh people can use
it for a long time so in that way we can cut cut the cost but w uh uh that we have to make the
battery as rechargeable one
and we we have a circuit board uh in a remote controller can you go to the next slide please and how it works how the remote controller works when you press a button
thank you uh when you press a button when you do that you complete a specific connection that means
when you when you press a button there will be a s a small circuit underneath the button and it will send some
signals through the wires and then uh the chip will send start connection and knows that which
button is pressed suppose you have pressed channel one button number one you have pressed then the uh chip
will know that the number one button was pressed it pros produces a mors morse code line signal specific
to that button
every button every individual button has its own morse code suppose uh the uh user has pressed butto
button one then it will have a spe the circuit will generate a specific morse code to b that that
button and the transistor will amplify the signal and send then to the l e d which translates
the signal into infrared light like you have got a signal by pressing a button that's a
d a morse code has been generated by the integrated circuit
now that signal that morse code has to be amplified by the transistor that is the use of transist transistor
we which we use in the remote controller it will amplify the signal and it will send it to the l e d and which translates
the signal into an infra infrared bits the sensor on the t v can see the infrared light and seeing the signal
seeing the signal re it reacts appropriately that when it sees the amplified mo morse code signal
then it will uh it will uh know which uh what what action it has to uh do
then it will do the appropriate action so uh this is how the remote controller works
can you go to the next slide please
yeah i have few pictures when you look at the uh um remote controller uh it's it's it this is a normal remote controller and to the next slide please
and where we had a a few buttons and all and uh if you open the remote controller you have this circui circuit
board and few electronic components like you can see a chip there which is having eighteen pins
and also a capac uh a capacitor three resistors and also a resonator uh
um mm yeah and di and a diode transistor
the electronic components uh all of the electronic components have all those uh things like a chip and d diode transistors an
yeah di um can y uh you can see the t a double one eight three five labelled uh chip um
uh you can also see the uh uh the green two green things are uh these are they are they are resistors
and uh just beside that you can see a transistor and a uh uh cylinder shape uh that one is
a capacitor uh and also there are uh um resistors uh sorry ther there is a diode
can you go go on to the next slide
so uh this is the circuit board the green one is a circuit board actually uh building a circuit bo board is pretty
pretty uh easy and also it's a it's a l l inexpensive uh it's it costs less than what you print
on a paper because uh uh when you when you are building uh some circuits some um uh circuits
and also wires it's it's better to go for printing because uh you can build these kind of k
circuit boards on a on a bulk and it's just printing nothing like uh you know you don't need to use wires and
all it's not exactly wires we are using it's just printing something on a board tha tho those
prints will acti act as wires and ci uh circuits
so th that green uh thing is a circuit board and also you can see uh there are b s like uh
um access for buttons like when you press a button the circuit under the button
will be activated uh th it will it will he get some signals from it and it will uh it will ch its
ch se send a signal signals to the yeah um integrated circuit can you go to the next slide please
uh so this is these are the circuits un underneath the buttons uh can you see the black uh round marks they they are the circuits
next please and um like uh we have uh designed uh before we have seen
some uh few things like instead off buttons we have some scrolls uh b but a b
a push button requires a simple chip underneath it but whereas a scroll wheel requires normally a regular chip
which is a higher price range like for s scrolls we have to go for a sophisticated and and k uh uh
uh full a complete chip uh and a as energy source we offer a basic battery a
more ingenious uh hard dynamo um a kinetic provision of energy
more than what is that you shake casually to provide energy so that also we can have in a battery uh
or we can use solar sells uh
yeah
uh yeah uh the product can be de delivered into different cases uh usually the cases and card flat that w we see usually uh d uh a normal remote controller um
yeah
yeah maybe d uh i have just one more slide i think um
like we can have a ma material such as plastic rubber wood titanium but titanium we can't use um
and also for electronics we can use a simple and regular um re or an advanced chip on
the print um also infra it includes the infrared se sender um yeah
the uh for the movie just to j develop uh samples and so spe sample speaker
an yeah that's it
it's all for me now thank you
no no no th the the the scrolling wheels are different like you can go for a sw switches like buttons or scrolls
uh which which we used to do before ten ten years before i think now nobody uses that because you need you need a
a k sophisticated chip and all so i think it's better we go for uh um ordinary buttons
yeah uh yeah push buttons yeah yeah
mm hmm
yeah but w
yeah
yeah but but i what i'm uh very very much doubtful how how uh far it will work because a speech recogniser like i it it has its own uh uh problems issues
yeah it's not distance problem it it's recognising a person's voice like maybe different people will be having different voices so it like it's uh everything so i
so to get a good recogni recognising system it's a costly thing i think
mm hmm
yeah but yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah
yeah yeah
yeah
yeah
and also strong
trendy yeah
uh
um like the switches like we use buttons for user interface
push buttons
yeah
mm yeah
hmm
mm hmm yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm

yeah
thank you
hi


yeah i think that pretty much is it yeah mm hmm






you don't know me i could lose that in a minute



well um looks like we still have quite a choice of things out there um what uh
i'm no suggestion's bad but uh we're gonna have to narrow it down a little more i don't think that we can get
uh the t shape is good the child one is good the too big to misplace i think it's just
funny um i don't think that's gonna be our impulse
purchase at the checkout counter it's it's gonna be a little bit too unwieldy
yeah mm mm hmm
have to come back to that later okay
no i think her presentation was good and she really explored all the options yeah

mm hmm

mm hmm good point

mm hmm
mm hmm


mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
yes

yes
okay
hmm that's interesting
uh yeah on the scroll and the push button um ca you can achieve scrolling by repeatedly pushing a button
mm hmm

um
we'll just go for push buttons for in the interest of cost okay

okay go right to my first my next slide
um alright my method is uh i'm interested in what the competition is doing
and wanna see how we can make ourselves different from the competition so i've really been looking at
the press and the ads that are out there for other remote controllers i s i spend a lot of time on the internet
um surfing around doing the same thing and then when i'm out um in people's houses
or at meetings or anything like that i try to notice what kind of remote controls people have and if
it's convenient in the conversation i ask about it and i would encourage you all to do the same um and my
findings from this is that you know small is beautiful um people like something that really fits in their hand
simple is beautiful they don't want to have to squint at small print um they want buttons
whose functions are obvious and they want um as few buttons as possible and they don't care for the
mode thing they want each button to do something and eye catching is important it's gotta look cute it's gotta
look appealing go ahead i'm trying to finish fast for you um and our preference is as
far as i'm concerned are we got to get to the market before the competition ours has to be look really great and it has
to come out before the others so that we have a leg up on time to sell it and push it before other people get out their
christmas item and we should develop one or two features we can really dwell on in our ad campaign
if we try to tell people it has too many great features um the consumer just gets confused and we don't
get anywhere so we've gotta narrow our selection down to li two things i think that we gonna say are really great
about our our our new product and i've been looking around um at what designs
every year different things are popular and in my research this year i found out that fruit and vegetable shapes are really
popular and people are tired of hard plastic and hard metal they are more back
into soft feel spongy feeling things things with maybe a little cloth on them so those are things
maybe we wanna look at as far as saleability of the item

mm hmm

you wanna try to come back to yours and limit yours a bit
okay
so speech recognition is most important as far as you're concerned
yeah h that could that could that could be our star feature that that be really good yeah i agree with that
distance problem
uh

i think i think battery and i think we all agreed on that that that's that's gonna be most cost effective and the best thing
yep
bright colourful trendy trendy design and strong
mm hmm

well i think that
yeah or or like her speech recognition would also be a supplement her speech recognition feature would be a supplement
okay so why don't we put down speech recognition if possible pending some more research from our industrial engineer on how expensive that is

okay


wherever they're hiding
okay uh good afternoon this is our third meeting already
i hope you enjoyed your lunch i did anyway um
let's see
presentation three okay this is um the second phase
uh we're going to discuss today it's the conceptual design meeting and
a few points of interest in this meeting um are the conceptual
specification of components
uh conceptual specification of design and also trend watching um these are hopefully the points you addressed in uh your pre uh presentations you're going to show me in a few minutes
um but first i'll show you the agenda uh first the opening
then we have three presentations uh after that we have to come to a decision on remote control
concepts how we're going to make it and then we're closing we have
about forty minutes
uh so i suggest let's get started uh did someone encounter any problems during the preparation
no everything fine that's nice
then a little uh thing about the last meeting
uh these are the points um we agreed on the requirements and the target market uh requirements
are uh teletext docking station audio signal small screen with some
extras that uh button information and we are going to use default materials
um does somebody have any comments on these requirements maybe
no these are just the the things we thought of so maybe if you figured something else or thought of
something else just let me know and maybe we can uh work it out
and we're going to target uh sixty to to eighty year old customers
so now everybody knows what we're do we're doing um i suggest let's get started with the presentations
so shall we keep the same uh line up as uh last time
okay
good luck
okay thank you any questions about the the trends mayb
no okay we go on to the next one

okay
uh thank you
okay thank you
so that brings us to the discussion about our concepts
mm
'kay
so these are the points we have to discuss
um first
i think we can talk about the energy source since that's um
has a pretty big influence on production price uh and image uh so
uh f i think first of all we have to see uh it is possible to introduce kinetic energy in our budget i think
yeah
okay

yeah
no
yeah okay
yeah
yeah
uh
uh well i think uh elderly people just like to have everything in place
and i don't think they they like uh remotes just laying everywhere in their
rooms so maybe a docking station will help them give the remote a place
and also what you said um you can introduce voice recognition by
uh finding back your remote but i think it's um more efficient
and cheaper to put it in the docking station so you have a but button on your docking
station which you can push and then it starts beeping
and then we can we can still use the voice recognition but maybe then for only the the channels
that's safe
yeah that's a good point
yeah sure go ahead
no
yeah
yeah
yeah
easier to use no i think that's a good point
yeah
i personally think the l c d screen we wanna use with the extra information i think nobody has anything against it because it's just uh some extra information and it's easy to ignore as well so if you don't wanna use it you just don't use it
and um yeah i think the um maybe we have to uh
discard the voice recognition because it will increase cost
uh signifi uh significantly and i don't think the i don't think it will be a lot
easier to use as well
so that brings us back to the energy if we don't have the voice recognition it will it won't use a lot of energy to use um
so in that case we could use kinetic uh energy but i think just a simple battery which you can reload on a docking station is just as good and much cheaper as well
so
okay let me just choose for the battery that brings us to the chip
just the advanced
okay advanced chip
and then we get to the point of the case um which
brings us a little bit back to marketing as well uh if we wanna
choose for wood or the black and grey or both
um as we saw there is not yeah wood is a lot more expensive to
produce um but i think it will attract
elderly people who wanna have something exclusive which they can show off to
their grandkids look i've got a new remote control and uh
yeah
that's right
but with colour was a lot more expensive or
you don't know
i think so because yeah it's a lot more difficult to to handle and to to get in the right shape
yeah
change the cases yeah
you can sell the cases yeah i think that's a very good option because um
then you can advertise as well with the give your grandfather a new case for his remote control
or whatever
because that's a it's something extra it's something other remotes don't have which we can get a great advantage point so and then you can make them with colour black and grey other colours as well
costs
yeah
yeah so you suggest we should design two different telephones
on which you can apply yeah remote controls on which you can apply different case covers for example
remote
yeah
okay
so everybody's okay with the changing covers
i think that's a good uh good option
changing case covers
yeah
mm okay
uh but the form has to be um it has to
it's has to be possible to stand up or just only to lie down
and the the cover of the the docking station is also
on top of the television then or not
and you can just yeah then click it in that's okay um so the interface what type of interface do we want to use
um maybe you can make a little drawing of it on the
on the the board does somebody have ideas for a form or
yep
mm
usabili yeah ease of use will be a lot more difficult and then it's

but you have extra buttons so people can get confused
especially if they have the same writings on it
can't we make uh can't we make a remote which you can flip over and use
on the same
functions as the normal one
then you have to
let's see if i ca
a blank one
and then you get
here's a little l c d screen
uh now i have to think

it's a plus and a min
no it's not very handy i think because the plus and the min will be opposite and all kinds of
no that's not gonna work
i guess maybe we should yeah but is it a problem that left handed persons use a different hand i think the functions are
that basic that nobody should have any problems with uh choosing a channel or
y yeah yeah i think we could just uh leave it a normal shape
uh but maybe we have to
make it a l a bit more fancy in one or ano another way
yeah
um yeah just
yeah
easier
'kay i suggest um the single curved because maybe the
curve is pretty good to put the the screen in uh so that elderly people
can uh use the remote control and at the same time look easily at the screen because
it's a bit it has a bit of a angle
yeah i think so yeah
but now it's
do you have it upside down or do you have it this that's top
okay

yeah
so get your mouse yeah
yeah that's a good one but i think it's better to put the screen uh on top
so just flip it a hundred and eighty degrees around then you get here if you can have this one you turn it like this and then flip it upside down
because uh maybe your hand is in the way if you have the display here
i think i
on top
yeah
so then we get
here's that's the curve
here the display and then buttons yeah and then we can have a little bit off here and here maybe just that's for left hand and right hand users
and then h the rest of the buttons over here
yeah still here jus
that's
yeah
should be more bit more friendly yeah
'kay
supplements that's okay
where's my mouse then
we've got a general idea of the concepts and the materials we're going to use so now
for the next meeting uh we'll have to look at the look and feel design it's important that the corporate
design image uh is going to be in the remote so check out the corporate website maybe
the user interface design it's the same story and product evaluation
so the industrial designer and user interface designer are going to work together on this one
but you're going to get your instructions i think sended by the coach
so just um i will put these um minutes on the in the folder
and then we're going to uh try to finish our project and uh make
a good design for all the grandfathers and grandmothers i think which are
uh let's see i'm not sure if you're going to start right away to work together or
i think you're going to fill in the questionnaires first and then you'll get a message
so that's uh basically it maybe this one then we can save this one in the
folders group
uh yes it's here smartboard there it it so if you wanna have a look at it it's over there in the projects folder
and then i guess we'll start in thirty minutes again
thank you
no
mm no

um 'kay um yeah uh some uh research uh a about
um designing of an interface um the uh last meeting uh we had a about
um uh using a f few buttons so uh um
uh that's w what i what i want to uh
uh to do in uh our design so um finding an
attractive uh way to control uh the remote control um the uh
i found some uh something about uh speech uh recognition so maybe uh we can uh
use uh that um
uh and uh using a little uh display so um findings um yeah just um we have just to focus on the primary um functions
so uh only uh buttons uh for uh sound um for uh on off um uh
shifting u up uh sa uh ca channel or uh down shifting down um
uh let's see um yeah and
uh we uh need some uh new a attractive functions uh uh
which attract uh uh people for using it so uh it's uh
like a speak uh speech uh recognition and um a special button for selecting uh subtitles just
uh what we uh mentioned uh last uh meeting
um and yeah overall um user friendly so uh using uh large large buttons um
it's uh possible to uh uh to make um quite cheap uh system for uh speech uh
recognition um you can think about um uh when you lost your um remote control
you can uh call it and um it gives an um sig signal so uh uh yeah
and and uh for uh shifting up a sen uh c ch channel or
uh for um uh putting out uh sound or something you can uh just give a
sign uh say um sound off or
a and uh yeah television uh put the sound off uh put the sound off uh um
let's see uh yeah i was thinking about the special uh button for uh subtitles um just one button to keep it uh simple uh one push on the button uh you get uh uh small uh subtitles
um double push push um if double click um so uh you get uh big uh subtitles for uh people uh
um uh which c f uh who can't uh read small uh subtitles so uh um
yeah and w we have to keep uh in general buttons uh so um we've got um the buttons we have to use the on off sound on off sound higher or lower um the numbers uh zero to uh uh nine
um the general buttons m more general b one button for shifting up and shifting
down uh channel um also we want to uh use a little d display
uh for um for displaying the uh the functions of the buttons
and um we can uh build in a function f which uh shows the channel or
some uh which the t television is on so um
made a little uh picture of uh it um
see
um yeah just um we can put uh the on off button
uh over in this uh corner um almost uh e all uh remote
controls uh are using a on off button on that place um so uh people uh will
uh recognise uh um the button so um
d display uh of it it's uh just a small display uh um you can put it uh on top um it's uh most uh
uh place where people uh most of looks at so uh um
and a special uh button for shifting up uh and uh shifting down uh channel um
it's uh on place where um the thumb of of the
so you you can uh easily uh shift up or shift down um it's uh quite uh
handy place so um and uh all the f functions for subtitle uh one button uh for sound uh
uh and uh for our design um uh we have to discuss about it uh i think uh so uh the form of it so
and that's it


mm

nah

but
what's the function yeah f for loading up uh the batteries
b b
okay but uh it won't use uh much e energy uh i i believe uh
it's uh just a small display so i believe uh it will run on one battery for
um six months or f or or more so i believe one battery uh
is just enough uh so
okay
yeah that's true yeah
mm hmm
yeah
okay
yeah
uh
mm
mm

'kay
yeah
but uh is uh our uh research um about um bi large uh l c d sh uh display or uh just a small one uh we want to uh use
okay
yeah
no
yeah
yeah
mm hmm
yeah
uh i dunno
mm
mm
uh is it possible uh to make um changeable uh case so um uh
you 'cause uh yeah with uh mobile phones uh uh so uh like the nokia
mobile phones uh when you can change the case of it so
maybe it's possible uh possibility so um um you have just to make one um standard um remote control and um yeah you can sell uh few uh yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah

yeah
okay
mm
uh we can just use the regular form of it but it's um not quite uh fancy so um
yeah
yeah yeah

for uh uh for yeah yeah
mm
yeah we um
is it possible to um program it s so uh you got on the left side uh or on the right side
uh buttons for for shifting u up and shifting up and on the uh other uh uh o other
side uh buttons for uh shifting uh for for the sound or
or isn't it
yeah okay
uh
mm
yeah but

yeah
yeah
yeah
see um yeah or we have to make a left uh for lefties and
um

you mean um
yeah if
mm no
yeah
um
yeah
it's just uh u using uh your thumb so um it's
yeah
yeah um
yeah yeah
mm hmm
mm

so um
do you say this um
s uh
uh you got like uh sort of a i believe there
so um you want to put a display over here or not yeah
um
yeah uh we can make it um mm that's
the top so uh this top this down um maybe it's possible to
uh make this side like um let's see um
colour uh okay
uh to make this side um like mm
the right colour um bit like so uh um in the form of your hand so um
uh it's an
so so the remote control have to um lay in your hand so uh it's possib um yeah for s so and
and to put uh the the buttons for um
changing uh the channel uh over here uh
yeah
uh rem
yeah but this place um
uh it's yeah i dunno um
yeah

yeah so
so

five minutes
yeah
yeah but um the on off button um still on the top uh yeah
yeah
yeah 'kay

yeah
yeah
yeah
okay

okay
about the components design um for the energy source we can use a basic battery
or a as an optional thing a kinetic energy like in a watch which you just
shake and it produces energy but if we choose for that option the docking station
would c become obsolete so i don't think it's really an option
uh for the casing uh the uh manufacturing department can deliver uh a flat
casing single or double curved casing it's really up the the design that we're gonna use it's uh
doesn't uh imply any technical restrictions
uh as a case supplement we could um i thought of that l later uh a rubber uh belt like a anti slip
uh for the b buttons we can use plastic or rubber and the chip set um it says simple here but it should be advanced because we're using an l c d uh screen
and as uh the trend watcher presentation showed um people like wood
but it raises the price and it doesn't really fit the image unless we would start two product lines
form should follow function overall
um well the kinetic energy source is rather fancy but
depends on what we want i think we should disc discuss that um for the case
uh the supplement and the buttons it really depends on the designer and the chip set uh really
should be advanced because otherwise uh it would really be a simple uh remote control
and that's it
yes w there there are four options we could use the basic normal battery uh a hand dynamo
but i don't think that's really an option you don't wanna swing before you can watch television
uh solar cells but not every room is very light so it's not a very good option or the kinetic
energy
well y you basically shake your remote and then it powers up yeah
yeah that's true
oh
mm i don't have any information on pricing so i'll have to ask the manufacturing department
but that would also go for the l c d screen then i guess
it's a bit higher percentage but
okay
and that's the best choice
well there isn't any choice there because we're using the the the the display so it's gotta be advanced

mm i dunno i'll have to uh research


yes
yes
well the the general like most older remotes are flat just straight and uh our d manufacturing department can also deliver single curved or double curved ca curved cases
um it would just only affect the form for as far as i know so it's j really just up to the design department what we're gonna use it doesn't really matter for the price or the functionality
pick one you like yes
yeah
i think we should start by by choosing a case because that's the basis you're building on
so i could draw them out
let's look at the flat case
oh
it's from the side so it's rather normal the the single curved so i'm not really sure what they're gonna look like but i think it's something like this
so this type should be better for you or better should prevent repetitive strain injury a bit
and the double curved s looks something like this i guess
so th those are the three options we have
yeah
it's more logical to have it on top as well because like on your mobile phone it's always above
oh maybe you should just s start on a blank page
okay

okay
good afternoon

sure i'll start off then
doh
'kay i'm uh gonna inform you about the trend watching i've done over the past few days um we've done some market research we distributed some more enquetes questionnaires
and um besides that um i deployed some trend watchers to milan and
paris to well get all of the newest trends and i've consulted some
additional trend watch trend watchers after the original trend watchers return about what
the
the best design would be um okay these are
some overall findings um most important thing is the fancy design
um the research indicated that that was by far the most important factor
um innovativeness was about half as important as the fancy design by innovativeness this means um functions which are not featured in other remote controls
um about half of half as important as the innovativeness was the
was easy to use um for our um
group we're focusing on the people of sixty to eighty y years old this is um
these factors are slightly more equal
'kay these are some more group specific findings uh the older people prefer dark colours uh
they like recognisable shapes and familiar material and our
surveys have indicated that especially wood is pretty much
the material for older people um this is this image will
give you a little bit of an impression about um the look and feel
that um the remote should have
um this leads us to some personal preferences uh the remote control and the docking station should uh blend in in the
in the room um so this would mean no uh
eye catching designs just keep it simple and well the docking station
and small screen would be our main points of interest because this would be the these would uh be
the innovativeness in the remote control
so this would be very important that we at least include these features um
well the trend watchers i consulted advised that it b should be the remote control and the docking station
should be telephone shaped so you could imagine that uh the remote control will be standing up straight in
the docking station
this is not really this is pretty much a new shape to uh older people so
they would prefer uh a design where the remote control just lies flat in the docking
station so it would be kinda more telephone shaped
um besides that we would advise um to bring two editions one with a wood like colour
and maybe feel and one with a grey black colour the wood like for the more
uh exclusive people people with more money uh the grey black colour for
well
people with less means
that would be all
any questions


and how exactly does the kinetic energy work you just
you use it and it works
okay well personally i don't think that older people like to shake their remote control before they use it
and besides that you mentioned it would make the docking station obsolete and i think our docking station could be one of the marketing issues with which we can um
get great popularity for our product
um wel
yeah you could load up the batteries you could um insert the find the lost remote control function in there
that's true
i'm wondering um what will the voice recognition mean for the production price
'cause in our earlier um market research if you'd allow me to go to the flat board smartboard
um so it was open here
um we also um
asked if w they would if people would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control well you can see here our target group would not do that so if that would increase the price for which we're selling our remote control
i would greatly advise not to do it i think that would be better to uh insert in our other product that is meant for the
younger people
um well this is yeah but this is here the question was would you prefer it
so that doesn't really mean they wouldn't pay extra for it and on top of that the l c d screen would
um help in making the remote control easier to use
and i think a voice recognition function would not make the remote control much easier to use
um well this was for like an l c d screen like you would have on a on the the most advanced mobile phones
so pretty large
'kay
mm hmm
mm hmm
well and i think most important factor there is the wooden colour so it wouldn't actually have to be wood if it's just
wood coloured
probably

yeah that is true
yeah we would have to look carefully into the design though
'cause we would have to make one w uh control which would fit in with a wooden cover and a
plastic cover the more original one or the more standard one
so that would
well i wouldn't design a telephone but
well no i think w we should just we should then just design one um
one remote but it would have to be fancy with either the wood cover or the plastic one
so but that shouldn't be too much of a problem
um i heard our industrial designer talk about uh flat single and double curved could you explain that a little more
mm hmm
and what would single curved and double curved mean
okay
so we can pretty much just do whatever we want
'kay
that's good
no just to lie down
we'll go for that
well or besides it

mm hmm
um you uh said you wanted to put the um changing channels button
on the right side so you could so your thumb would be easily well uh i think that was a very good point 'cause i pointed out
earlier that a lot of remotes cause r s i so that would be great for that
um i thought maybe we could just make one of those buttons on both the left and the right side
for left handed users also
for the volume um well that could
yeah we could do that but i'm not sure if that would be very good for the easy ease of use
but if we would make um a changing channels and changing volume button on both sides that would certainly yield great options for the design of the remote
'cause it could be made all symmetrical and stuff
that is true
yeah

yeah that is true
yeah
mm hmm
mm
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah
yeah
mm hmm
and i'd prefer the corners to be round
think that would be better
friendly on the eye

yeah
yeah
very good
wonder how much of the meetings is talking about the stuff at the meetings yeah

not a lot no
hmm okay sounds like you've done some stuff so
'kay
hmm
hmm everything yeah hmm
yeah yeah yeah to just have the sort of main same sort of idiom throughout kinda so
hmm
yeah
hmm
yeah yeah but then it's not as extensible like if we wanna add more things in the future then we have to well new buttons i don't know whereas a menu type thing is more flexible that way but we're probably not gonna be adding too many things
okay exactly i know i know true true yes
hmm
hmm yeah
actually
yeah but maybe tie that in with dialogue acts or something as well i mean speaker characterisation tied into i don't know di just
some way to sort of leverage that information like we have it we're doing it but what how does it help the browsing or
what can it give us in the browsing yeah yeah
hmm
right
yeah true yeah
is that just from the main main window is that is that from any particular window like if we wanna sorta get like if we were on the users versus like topic or something have a right click from for these various things to yeah
right yeah yep
okay yeah
now it's consistent throughout so yeah
right
actually yeah like um another common thing like if we have it so it's set up that um if you double click and it goes to a default thing on the menu
i mean that's kind of a typical kinda action that would happen if you double click on a particular topic or something then it goes to
sort of a like a default view so it'll be like all the um cases of that topic either
whatever we decide the default to be whether it's in all meetings or just in one meeting and just show up the the particular instances
of that topic in a meeting like i'm just thinking to have the default there so if somebody knows exactly what they wanna do and we know that that's
the most common thing that's gonna happen so the double click will do that and so save them the trouble of right clicking and choosing the item on the menu
well it might come to us as we start playing with it
um like we have the the right click menu you'll have the menu right click it but instead of like have a default double click so if there's a de so it'll be a choice from the menu but yeah exactly yeah
yeah
hmm
yeah yeah
hmm
yeah exactly well then they close it yeah you know it's not it's not the end of the world
yeah yeah
okay

hmm
mm
well yeah
mm hmm
i think we probably need that though to have the f the full flexibility we need to have that there but um yeah
mm hmm
although the thing is typically though is someone gonna have five windows open at the same time probably not probably just two or two or three of whatever whatever they're looking at like dialogue acts to whatever characterisations
hmm
yeah true
hmm
so like have a tab there for something like that choose on choose one
yeah

oh you should be able to yeah yeah yeah
yeah or even just have buttons on it toggle buttons or something on the tool bar for that window
just something
a lot of different ways we can do it it doesn't doesn't have to be a tab or whatever just gonna be yeah yeah
yeah exactly
or check marks even have two of 'em checked and send yeah yeah
yeah yeah exactly yeah
mm hmm
yeah
true
oh yeah okay
yeah yeah like a lot of these can be like once we get the disfluencies out then we can you know have transcript without the disfluency
transcript with the disfluent disfluency have all these you know have all these sort of using the same window and so we can put a lot of
and probably mutually um whate distinct yeah exclusive yeah
yeah
hmm
right
yeah that kinda makes sense
by the end of february
okay right
yeah
yeah mm hmm yeah
yeah so we can plug it in and
hmm
mm hmm
hmm
actually is the code accessible like the the gui stuff that you've done yeah like can we just like copy like the latest stuff out of your directory somewhere or like if we're gonna just try and like take a look or something try and just plug some stuff i think you can if
well if you just tell us the directory and just make the file readable then we c know the directory to get in then and just
that might be might be an idea
yeah i think by default they are i think really or
yeah okay
okay alright
okay
or you could just email to us okay yeah yeah okay right yeah right okay
okay
yeah yes

lower case
yeah

hmm

right
um all the searching stuff like the the in inverted file stuff and um the next search query and all that hmm
yeah so you could probably just use that code like that was behind the question she asked him earlier just you know the re using code and stuff was just like okay good
um apparently
yeah yeah yeah
yeah
yeah probably we'll probably still have to do some other file manage while i don't know creation messing around still though yeah
yeah
yeah um
hmm
yeah
huh okay right
okay
right
yeah it's good idea
yeah
mm hmm libraries
hmm
right yeah yeah yeah exactly exactly so you're still working i see
yes exactly same yeah i mean betwe um i sup yeah yeah
right
well well you're in s p n l p and s p two right so yeah yeah that's where i'm at
hmm
yeah yeah oh yeah

yeah that's fun
oh yeah
okay so yeah i was thinking that we can probably get uh start attacking this seriously and then
just um yeah hopefully have something by next week that we can sorta try integrating into the gui
okay think that should be possible
okay why
hmm well they did say it wasn't the most efficient very clearly yeah yeah
yeah
okay
hmm right right
yeah m yeah yeah
hmm
yeah seriously on the weekend
yeah well f
uh um yeah yeah how many hours is this hmm
yeah seriously
hmm yeah yeah that's what i gotta work on
mm
who was doing that
oh really
damn
yeah yeah
these can be changed as well okay yeah um i don't know it doesn't matter if if you want to i mean it's just you know play around with some extra stuff you have some time why not

hmm
was that in informatics course or oh oh it like digital okay okay
yeah
hmm
alright yeah
fine hmm
yeah i'll be happy when this week is over
yeah well i don't know is that about it then or anything else we need to discuss
did we wanna meet before we talk to steve next week
well i dunno we'll probably get some work done over the weekend so i dunno if after d n l g or something maybe just have a little quick little update and just
yeah well we can decide yeah exactly true yeah
search and well sure why not couldn't be that
hard well it'll be you know still limited version of you know the next query
search but no no won't be the whole thing then um like we can just decide sort of things that we do wanna
do hmm yeah well actually most are just dialogue acts and what else was there
summary topic
yeah
yeah
yeah it'll get behind schedule yeah pretty quick like you're saying yeah well actually do we wanna set a date for interim prototype
specifically a date
yeah
okay
is it semblance of reality yeah
i see


right true mm decide on that on over the weekend
yeah
right
yeah totally
oh just like the basic so like no sorry
yeah just like all the and seeing the code and just sort of how just see the basics of what you've done like just get a a quick look over and just
the basics yeah or like like you know the class paths all that sort of thing like just just say okay well here's
you know everything's basic in set up and then just yeah just jump right in
yeah
yeah that's cool yeah in the morning
yeah yeah yeah i know well thing is you know if yeah something like that could happen
anytime 'cause uh yeah like my schedule's like a class break class break class you know that sort of thing so
so yeah i know exactly exactly that's what i'm thinking so something like that and then if i have a class i can run off and do whatever
yeah okay
actually monday monday might be good d um
yeah yeah
anytime um not at n not at noon or two or four no in between those is you know like one or three or
sure
possibly
yeah
yeah that's an option too yeah after
sure that's fine
yeah or three thirty no just yeah that'd be necessarily necessarily short
actually we can't get in there though
w we well we can get in through the through the the card the card door yeah
how about if we take uh a tour yeah right yeah yeah exactly
okay just sort bang on it actually i was asking steve about that whether we can get in there whether he was gonna get us access into the
the computer room
yeah print
okay
right is there a printer in there too

a nice okay that would come in handy yeah
hey we could we could photo copy our um assignment if we wanted to yeah well the comments i'm thinking
um
yeah that's true so after d n l g yeah
as long as d n l g doesn't go late

oh
so
sounds like me
are you next week or the week how
oh
yeah that's cancelled
oh really
hmm
um something like that i think one or couple classes were cancelled
yeah exact yeah i th
yeah
i think it was up to the professor whether they did it or not well i don't feel like teaching yeah okay i think yeah i think d i l will probably have one to make up for missing classes d i l will probably have classes yeah
yep
you can have it yeah
huh which one the top one um
do you really want multiple windows from a single lap
but most will probably want to go with defaults
yeah yeah you'd be s
yeah exactly and just the other comment about whether you wanna do both speaker characterisation and topic segmentation
yeah yeah that's about it nothing terribly exciting
okay
yeah alright okay so

okay yeah
okay

okay
so what do we need to talk about



yeah
uh
yeah
good start oh i don't mind as well this wasn't a good start
okay sorry yeah
yeah
can you use double click or
yeah i don't know
yeah
and then
i guess a button button makes a bit more sense 'cause otherwise you don't really know that oh what if i right click now what happens then it's like more if it's visual yeah
do you see my
yeah
but well we we can have both but whatever


yeah um i don't i mean it w it's more like part of the
browsing sort of thingy more than the speaker characterisation as m steve mentioned um i don't really know how to involve the speaker characterisation into the browsing
yeah well
yeah i mean i guess maybe we could have that as another thing of like well if
you get the speaker characterisation that someone s talks a lot in uh a certain topic
and then if you i don't know click on that topic you get everything that's in that topic
or whatever and in that way but i don't know
no no no yeah

yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
uh just let th
yep
yeah
like i don't know show the speaker characterisation for instance or just i don't know
but if you do double click on something don't you expect something to happen then
sort of well i don't know
yeah

yeah yeah uh that was good start
i don't know
i guess it depends on the
yeah what you're clicking on obviously
single channel
no
no
yeah
but uh well couldn't we i mean you probably i don't know if you wanna have like the the full transcription and the summary at the same time
so maybe you can just like choose the s same window for transcription and summary
yeah yeah tabs are nice i like tabs yeah
i don't know how easy it is but i dunno but
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah or just i don't know yeah uh change the contents of the same window like from transcription to summary
probably yeah
hmm
yeah yeah that could probably
no no it could be like transcription summary like two buttons and you just press on which ever you want
yeah
yeah i don't like pop ups
i guess that yeah
yeah
he's close
yeah um well could uh i don't know would transcripts uh b sounds reasonable to have like transcripts like maybe three alternatives then like full meeting meeting without disfluencies and summarise
yeah
um yeah

i guess it is i mean just to try it and i mean for us to to be able to do something that we can include with your thing so so eas yeah yeah
yeah yeah just so see the integration works sort of between the different compo
um
so i guess that's what we need to aim for
yeah
yeah well if i guess i mean that was probably our intention but we might not have written it down so i guess i know
yeah

yeah
alright


say that again o four


oh yeah
mm
okay

i could tell you what i done in s p two
oh um i don't know i basi i s started like browsing a bit just like trying to see if there's anything out there to use s sort of um just
yeah searching yeah well yeah we're doing the yeah yeah so it just found a tutorial but i inverted search in indexing but i haven't read it yet but
yeah yeah
yeah
yeah well i don't know if it's usable i uh can have a look th at it but but i found some code for like from a tutorial about i indexing uh whatever yeah
yeah yeah
yeah
yeah
um yeah i guess that's it
i don't know uh i'm i was a bit worried about when well when he talked about this with the mm file
messing around with files i mean uh how much do we actually need to do like extracting things from
the x m l files and stuff to be able to do the indexing
okay
okay what are you writing in java or yeah okay yeah
you know a bunch about file things
um yeah i guess i mean it was a good point you had that like collaborating with the file things i mean if you already started on on doing your stuff i guess we can
yeah
yeah should we i don't know
meet up and see what we could do i mean i don't know see what you've done and see what we need when we know more of what we need maybe or what do we need yeah yeah
yep yeah
well

yep

oh
um
yeah we're gonna meet up
yeah
'cause it's now
okay
okay but it what what is it like a window where you have to wr write the search query or is it just what's behind it so or how does it work then d okay
yeah
yeah
okay
yeah
okay
when you like you is there a open thingy or like well what did you two do to like how did you figure out that this uses n x t search like is it
okay
okay
yeah
mm hmm
yeah



oh yeah
yeah
oh no
yeah



yeah
mm i don't know
oh oh
yeah
yeah that's nice



sorry i'm just being yeah hmm
have we these courses that we're okay yeah
no
i don
yeah
yeah i don't know
yeah
yeah
yeah
no
mm
i don't know
mine was

the progress report is due on twenty third february february
um yeah
yeah
yeah
just looking at my own deadlines see yeah that would be fine
wasn't like what you had now wasn't that pretty much what we agreed on or was it just like that one

okay
this is illusion or whatever

oh mm
nice thought i'm impressed maybe you should make it exist then

yeah
yeah
it would be nice to i don't know meet up and uh you can sort of show us a bit what you know already so we don't sort of have to do all the work again of just like figuring out stuff
just like accessing the corpus and stuff
yeah
yeah


yeah yeah yeah
yeah
um yeah
yeah
next yeah this monday just

yeah
it's full yeah
yeah
well it doesn't matter for me i mean three three or after what
maybe we ca
in four buccleuch
we can go look we can look at now afterwards yeah
okay
into what okay uh
yeah
oh is that the photo copier i heard i heard about yeah
yeah
yeah
so what time do we say
yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah okay hmm

what
it's true
yeah i don't know it's reading week next it should be it shouldn't be any well it's supposed to be next week it's week six next week
i don't know we have one class at least when we like speech perception we don't have any lectures but i think we're having like all other classes so uh there's not point in having
no i think it w
yeah which are a bit crap yeah i think the under graduates had uh all were off totally

what
yeah th we will probably have it yeah yeah last week yeah
yeah um i guess that's it was there anything else do anyone know you wanna like take care of this or should i take care of it
yeah i don't know if there was something oh i think he basically said
um the same things as in the comments if i could read it
can you read that
yeah
from a single application
yeah well uh that was i guess
oh
no
oh yeah yeah and now we have seven percent of the course already done is quite good so if y
if you're okay with uh having oh
who yeah
we're done now i uh
is she still here yes you are yeah
yeah exactly yeah yeah yeah

should we
well should we just go around and everyone says what they d what they've been doing how far they've got well i hope so
okay well i've got a browser now which whoops already gone
mm hmm
yeah
okay
so yeah we've go a browser we've um which comes up automatically with a transcription
box and the topics and then when you go on the menu you can select a summarisation
box which pops up and an audio player
um and a s i think the search works as well so you could pop up a search and it loads up um just
the background window is empty and um so when you start you have to either open open
a particular observation or do a search and open it through that
does that make sense
um the transcription box has got a summarise but button which doesn't do anything
yet um now i wonder wh how we wanna do you know
we want a pop up window with the speaker characterisation
um either we could do that you know when does the pop up come either we can when you click on the the i d
any sort of i d in the transcription box or we can put an extra button extra
few buttons next to the summarise button so that you actually in the transcription box but so like you click on a button and
then that opens whatever that speaker characterisation is the problem is the r the left click
is already used because it highlights that um
that part of speech or whatever that what he's been saying you know the the left click highlights it
so that you can i don't know what happens when you double click actually but that'd be a bit annoying if
you have left click for one thing and double click for something else um i think so
yeah when you left click it you can for example set set the marker there so that the mm the audio goes from there i think
um so we can't put it on left click we could put it on a right click we could for example have a little menu that pops up
so right click on at menu you know and you can click on speaker characterisation up pops the window
that's a good point i don't know nothing else
yeah yeah but um i don't know about you but uh usually in windows right click doesn't do anything does it it opens a menu yeah so yeah so but that'd be yeah if you just yeah
yeah
um or just you know or just the button
well no no you still have the menu the menu pop up that
well oh yeah it's more obvious isn't it w what you can do yeah yeah that's right that's true yeah it's more intuitive really isn't it
maybe maybe
in the beta version um but actually what we could do is on in that menu as well we could have an option that pops up a window with all the all the meetings that that user has been in
like a search for that user is that gonna be useful or too much or
yeah so y when you right click on it one one option will be give me all your meetings characterise the speaker
or is that too much i mean
yeah yeah that's true yeah yeah
yeah that's true it'd nice to have it inconnec interconnected like
or you mean the the speaker characterisation oh well yeah i mean
i don't know about that i mean it's the speaker characterisation is a bit like you said i mean it's like a nice thing we don't we're not actually sure what the user wants with it but it's interesting so why not give it to him
i i think we should do it i mean
yeah i mean that's that's still another level further i mean we're not even there yet you know it doesn't even doesn't even pop up the speaker characterisation yet y we have to first define what what happens when you click on a user
yeah yes so should we try try to do a right click when you then
sorry
yeah yes wait yeah there's a second thing about the topics the topic window we wanna
somehow click be able to click on a topic and it pops up with all the meetings that contain that
yeah so we could do that in a similar way do it right click as well and to have a different menu for our
yeah
so yeah so we have basically two options of of browsing the meetings is by either um searching and opening individual observations and when then we have the interlinking by right click basically
double click
oh
hmm
yeah
i don't see there's anything obvious that was that would be able you know that would be
yeah but then then there's the problem with a lot of windows popping up again and they pop up without you even being quite sure what it is you know what i mean
yeah maybe mm hmm
especially if you have a touch pad it just goes oh well
i'll i'll check what it does on on um double click at the moment 'cause i think it might do something but
but yeah mm but i don't i don't i d really don't see anything obvious that that would
i mean if you can think of something that
sorry
sorry um yeah another thing single audio files do we wanna use them or not
yeah single channel that's single channel files do we want them i mean
yeah okay yeah yeah i mean we might use them while wo to work with them but do we wanna integrate them in so that when you browse you can here's
do you though i mean it's not gonna make much sense if you don't listen to it on its own d do you does it
no hmm yeah
yeah
yeah
um
yeah wh what do people think in general about the windows cluttering that he's mentioned do you think do you think it's really that bad
that's what i feel as well i mean i'm i'm very much i w i wanna have everything customisable um
probably not no yeah two or three maybe but yeah but yeah it depends i mean i i
really wanna put the summary in somewhere you know and the summary for example is typical you open the window you read
through it you might click on you know close it again straight away but it'd be good to have it there
i was just thinking of tab
that true yea yeah yeah yeah that's right i'm not sure yeah
no i don't know do you reckon i'm sure i'm sure you could do anything
hmm
i can have a look
but yeah that that might be an idea yeah
hmm
but i mean people get used to it i mean when you use a windows or linux for that matter you have a lot of windows open and you manage them
yeah you can minimise 'em yeah yeah
yeah that's true they're they're definitely
yeah they're definitely gonna be in the same window yeah
exclusive yeah that that was the plan for the disfluencies anyway so d
yeah do you wanna do that with summaries in put the summaries in in the same window
mutually exclusive with
summary yeah you wanna do that yeah
and finally the prototype he spoke about what kind of prototype could we produce
because i'm i'm just you know i go into the lab and i say right what am i gonna change today you know and it kind of just it just develops i'm not aiming for anything do we wanna aim for something
i'm i'm pretty much getting there anyway to be honest it's not it's not gonna be a lot more work
oh
hmm
mm true
oh right i see hmm
um probably not i don't know can you access other people's
yeah sure i don't know if it's readable at the moment but you can sure have a d have a look
alright
'kay right well i'll make that readable then um so the directory is my number
well this is not difficult it's in all the emails not o four o four five five five
six o
o four five five five six o
and then um there's a folder um n l s s d
and it's called the m browser
yes m for meeting
really no i'm i'm extremely organised you see i've got folders for everything i love folders

yep so that's me done someone else wanna talk about their stuff
mm hmm
w what where you doing again
the search okay
okay
indexing
oh
oh right oh that's pretty much there is it
of making
oh great
yeah that's handy
so you think it shouldn't be too difficult
oh i see yeah you have to convert it to some sort of format i suppose
i mean you should look at look have a look at the the browser code then because um you know they already extract for example transcripts put it into a window at least

what do you mean this week's only two days old
oh

yeah oh that's complete rubbish anyway never mind just so stupid
mm hmm
well ye the browser as i use it now or as uh you know it was there when i
took it um uses the um the n x t search to get the data
out of the out the files which i think is odd but i'm not quite sure how it works yet i don't quite understand
it
to get the data i for example to get the summarisation data you have to search for i think the i d s or something yeah
yeah
so they don't you know they don't say look in that and that folder but they say search everything
oh it does load up quite quickly so you know it's not too bad but you know you could have a look at them
no this is not the actual search this is just when you open what you know to load the transcript for example
to find the transcript for a certain meeting it does does an n x t search for the string
i don't know transcript or text or whatever
yeah
yeah so i don't know if you've looked at the search query s language but it's like a dollar a text say
yeah and then yeah because every every of all of these um
these files have got um tha an i d and all the transcript files have got the string i don't know what it is words or text or something in it so it just searches for those files
vaguely
so
open
um um well it's in the code just that it you know it yeah you define a search object and then you search on that string i had to figure out how to how to do the same thing for the summary that's how i
i had to i had to understand how to do the transcript how they did the transcript to do the summary myself
yeah just search for a specific string
so you could just you know you could use that when you if you wanna um take the data out and put it somewhere yeah
if you have a a question about w what the p the code means or where to find the code that you wanna you know whatever you wanna do then just send me an email
i can explain it
oh yeah actually in the moment it's got a load of rubbish because the the um the browser
that i used from this from you know that they gave us had a lot of extra stuff in and i haven't dared throwing out
to through out all the functions i haven't you know that i don't need yeah just in case exactly yes so
they're all in there ye still a lot of rubbish but they will be get will be chucked out right
at the end i think
yes exactly yes yeah precisely
the weekend the weekend's still four days off
oh
i don't actually have that much to do at the moment
well oh dear well
i can't remember what i'm supposed to do by the way am i supposed to do the summarisation thingibob

no
you do well i'll do that then
shall i do that then i mean
or you know
it shouldn't be to difficult i mean
well i'm doing communications which we had one exercise and i've done that like two weeks ago and that's in in two weeks
yeah it's a nine nine course as well or ten or something yeah
and then then i'm doing parallel programming languages and systems which we had one exercise as well and that's in like friday
well i'm not doing any background reading so you know being lazy
oh

yeah if you like we can always decide then i mean yeah yeah um so what what are you planning to do over the weekend then
you're gonna do the search you're gonna implement the search everything

mm hmm
it's just that i think we need to set ourselves some milestones because otherwise
you know
weeks will go by and
well you decide i'm not doing much for that prototype so
of
oh
well how about we get it done by then i mean
then we can write about it in the in the interim report and s you know and then we've got something to show
um oh and the the search interface
maybe you should decide pretty pretty early what kind of things you wanna be able to search for and then if you want you can give that to me and i'll i'll build a u nice you know a few tick boxes and drop down menus
no
oh that's that's that doesn't exist tha that's completely cut and pasted
that does not exist nicely done though isn't it it's actually
all these all these um things are are nicked from um you know all these drop down menus and tick boxes are nicked from google
online a screen shot of google
it's just so much fun it's gonna be a little difficult more difficult yeah
i mean i was going to but you know the whole drop down menus and stuff what we wanna search for
is not quite agreed on we never agreed on what we wanna be able to search for
so
yeah do you wanna you know just get together and think about the different types of search we could possibly do and then then we could discuss it next meeting which options we really wanna include
that would probably involve researching the query language a bit as well to see what that can do
know
know already what
oh
yeah
yeah yeah i can do that
show you what bits the code
yeah

ah yeah well this time i'm dictating the time 'cause i if i'm not there you can't do anything
yeah ah it's not gonna take an hour to explain it you know
i mean
pick a time i i you know let me know whenever
what monday what did you say


three o'clock actually th yeah
unless you wanna do it after the um after d
d and a
that's gonna be tight
yeah it what front door
i've not found that yet
really
really
ah well i'm just
i've got it in my computer whatever is in my computer
i just think it's better to do it afterwards then we have all the time we need rather than have half an hour and then we'll surely run out
oh
actually it's not even confirmed yet what was she doesn't even know what she's talking about yet i think maybe it doesn't happen at all
is it really
really
i don't think we have a reading week though the the
yeah i don't think there is an official i don't think there was an official one last semester i think it was just a bank holiday wasn't it
no
okay let's meet monday
hmm

right i think we need to tick the okay box right
ooh exciting
should we turn these off then or what
funky sh stuff like that
yeah yeah look at all this stuff man okay right
has anybody
has anybody done anything
you better start

good at this


right
d yeah
the l the left click or the right click
right
yeah it might be quite good i suppose yeah
what else could we have in the menu
okay so otherwise you just have a right click or do you have have a
is a window
a menu yeah yeah yeah it's why and so it might be a bit weird the fir to just start bringing up stuff and then it
yeah
yeah yeah it's more
it's more idiot proof isn't it it's got a button
add more buttons
yeah well in uh i guess in in in meeting browser one point one you can have a menu instead of a button but this why i don't think it yeah
yep
i guess so so what did you part of the m the menu that comes down it says give me all your meetings or something
yep
i guess so it's an idea get to use my pen

yeah yeah
oh yeah
we have to have a speaker characterisation first before we cross any of the other bridges so yeah there you go
yeah alright why not
even if only one thing comes up
okay so and so this lot is for um
on the t speaker
and then this lot is on th
what was that i didn't quite understand do you mean
yeah
oh so and it figures out what's the most common use to double click oh okay
yeah
sometimes you do it by accident though you oh go away stop coming up yeah no yeah yeah oh yeah t throw stuff throwing out the window
yep
we don't know yet do we i don't think do you mean the single channel
probably not but we might need them for disfluencies if we try do it in audio but at the moment no but yeah
we might want to be able to say oh just give me what that person's saying
unless um you can't hear it properly or something somebody's talking over somebody else or something well p
w we just say no for now and put it in later or something yeah yeah
yeah 'cause otherwise it will the it will increase the amount of data we need by a lot won't it therefore print will be bigger
yeah no i think it's i think it's fine yeah i think what we're doing is fine
yeah tabs are good mozilla style yeah
does anybody know how to do that or can you do that in java i don't think java knows how to do that really maybe yeah you probably can but but
if you really knew what you're doing but i don't know it's a bit of a cripple with java's windowing tool kit the eight is sometimes it's a bit of a cripple
yeah
yeah yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah that will reduce the number of um windows we needed wouldn't it which is quite good 'cause otherwise photoshop has a lot of windows if you ever use photoshop it's got loads and you're always g forever going no get out of the way there's always stuff in the way isn't there so
yeah
you do yeah yeah
yeah unless can you i don't suppose you can minimise them and stuff like that can you can you do that okay well it's alright then yeah of course you can actually yeah it's got everything
yeah sounds good

um
yeah that's what we need yeah something just slightly more than just that on its own yep
yep definitely
i think that's kinda as well isn't it really seeing it seeing it sort of start to do stuff rather than just be
a prototype with a gui
yeah yeah yeah
you can make it if you make it world readable then anybody can access it
yeah
no uh i i it no they're not world readable it not the default they're only default then only you can read them by default you can see them but you can't read them
yeah
what's your number
okay your number
okay
and then it's
n l s s d
the m browser for meeting
hope you hope you never have to look in my directory it's just pure chaos s
mine is serious chaos files everywhere
don't all jump at once
yeah
yeah what was on it
oh you found some code for it for the inde
alright
alright cool cool so even if it doesn't work you can jiggery pokery around and make it work y yeah
yeah yeah all sorts of nonsense but yeah by the basics is uh oh okay that's good
yeah
i've been trying to g write something to read the x m l and get rid of it and i can get
rid of it but i'm having trouble putting it anywhere else so it will come up on the screen
for the moment i haven't managed to put it into a vector or whatever in java to play with it but i guess it's not very difficult
yeah in java yeah
yeah
yeah yeah i'm sure they do yeah
yeah oh yeah i will i'm sure it's nothing difficult i'm sure i'm making a meal of it at the moment actually
yeah yeah absolutely yeah
should share as much as possible
yeah
yep
next week sometime yeah i actually haven't done anything this week 'cause this week's been manic
but well whatever it was last week then
the the the week as it as is rather than the proper week do you know what i mean do you know that it's been all a bit manic the last m the last
yeah
yeah that's right yeah and then we had to do an i r p whatever it was last week as well which is only a page long but it's quite difficult to write a page
more diffi it was it wasn't marked but it was i had to sit there and think about it for a bit which is a bit irritating yeah but s p n l p yeah
yep
so when it when it
that's pretty bizarre isn't it well i guess that's how it works they've got d
that is pretty bizarre
yeah yeah
that is pretty bizarre

wh
four and it w it li it just has an open variable transparent s list whatever find everything that's got that and then load
yeah yeah yeah 'cause that's the uh the declares a variable doesn't it and then they keep okay
right
oh see obvious
so did you have to write it in the way that they wrote it is that what you did
right
okeydoke
fish the data i was just thinking that yeah
mm
have you annotated your code nicely not yet
just in case mission critical yeah
commen commenting it out one bit at a time and running it does it work yeah okay get rid of that next good fun aye
so basically we go and go and do some work really i think that's the um the um the answer to that isn't it the long and the short of it
yeah proba i'm still at the bottom of the mountain
yeah
well should you find you want to explore any other perhaps you as your um uh quantify raising
you saw it yeah
so what courses should i pick to be not doing any work at the moment

yeah
oh so it's uh yeah

yeah me too

um
so so what's that two weeks basically
ish yeah
yeah okay

yeah that's it's quite impressive actually yeah

that's quite slow really yeah
no it's not is it yeah
can take us for a tutorial sometime
next week sometime


mm monday afternoon
uh
three is alright it was what time's d n l g four isn't it
three's good though i'll but we have s whatever what's you what would you prefer
we could three thirty in the in the computer room in here and then we can just go stra if you can't can you get in the front door oh you haven't got a key do you can none of you get in there
the k the f there's computer rooms in here the m s c computer lab and uh is in here well if you find me
i'll show you where i'll i'll let us all in there and we can all go in there yeah yeah
you do need to have a key for it like that's the thing it's got a lock door button
yeah somebody will answer it
yeah it's only got it's crap it's only got about four or five computers in but it would do quite good for our job 'cause it has not very uh p not many people in it very often
yeah there's fridge there and there's a photo copier with the code on it yeah yeah it's cool yeah

oh right
yeah yeah
hopefully it's not that man so it won't matter
some classes did and some classes didn't it's all a bit bizarre really they didn't really know what was going on
nah make 'em work
done
oh we trust you
yeah i think the comments are basically the same as what you said so it's
yeah
oof bu buzzes yeah
signing off innit log off

oops
mm
after lunch
yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm

'kay
yep

'kay
yep
fine it's okay with me
yep regarding those sizes which one you think will be light because we we have to take into consideration size also so maybe a standard triple a might take lesser space or and dynamo might take more space
uh
right
night
and are these like uh what are the life of the kinetic battery it like it runs for long time
mm hmm
okay
we c
solar would be slightly expensives
it's twelve point f
another question is like sorry w w which one would last the longest because we don't want customers to be like you know charging like a mobile phone every day
a remote control like so we have to s look at the life also
okay
so
mm hmm
okay
second thing is yeah and second question is like a mobile you can change the cover you call it a skin or whatever
so in this case if you're looking at like a customer can change the colour like from green parrot green to chilli red or something like that
so is that feature available in like uh titanium or it's like only specific to plastic or
mm hmm
yeah
something like
alright that could be a good idea
it could it would be comfortable to hold on also
sorry i didn't get the last part you're talking of
just what you said i i didn't get the uh meaning of it completely you're saying like
uh huh
okay
'kay
absolutely f for somebody who very often if he would a person who switches channels very often or does
use a particular function very often will find it very irritating to use a and he might spoil the touch pad very
fast compared to a button like if you keep punching with an pointer or whatever
and just one small question before like you are regarding the circuit since we are hav having a flip top we can customise the two circuits for different type of buttons like we are keeping the standard buttons on the top and the more complex buttons under this thing so we can divide the circuit like you know
mm hmm
okay
okay
okay uh
would like to share something which i did here first thing is uh basically on design we just took the input from the previous
meeting especially from the marketing and industrial design to check on the customer needs and feasibility
second is we checked into competitors the picture here shows one of the standard models offered by competitors here so y you generally
see there's not much of variety and like marketing team said uh people need trendy they are bored of black and white
so you generally see rectangular shape very monotonous kind of designs here
and uh second thing is there's too much of confusion here no particular remote is standard
like some some people have a
here you see this this is on a i i
i found th that uh only common feature is the ch uh channel control and uh volume control rest other buttons they are in a very disorganized and they are not consistent th with other models and all
okay and second as already discussed with william we are going to have m maybe a g g u i interface
in the f in the middle of the flip top and g graphic user interface basically which is what we d do in computer
have icons or touch pad or whatever which is
like you have on a l uh icons or something y you have is a good example of g u i graphic user interface
so basically not point or click
press any particular device he just has to click on that particular icon to simplify and on the top m repetitive
buttons which are like volume or channel changing and all could be on the pointing device that means the use of button
so he need not use a pointer to keep changing the channel if a person is frequent surfer
so we are having a combination of boards so f on the s simpler board on the top we have this button rubber buttons to keep frequently changing the channels

but
mm hmm
okay and you mean to the
and the lower distance oh f perfect
so the findings are too many cluttered buttons
repetition of certain but buttons which i already explained example the volume and channel control buttons all are confusing and in inconsistent okay we had a latest finding of voice recognition there was a mail
which mentions that our division has developed a new speech recognition s feature we have to check into the for
financial f feasibility whether we can incorporate it this at a low cost but for like
we had g um s response from the customers that they would like to have the feature of finding
it so it could be like where is the remote and the remote answers i am here some kind of thing or it gives
a b bleep sound or some kind of sound and if this can be incorporated this would be more uh
you can say trendy also and technologically innovative also
so we we can check into the financial feasibility of incorporating this
my personal preferences would be like as already uh marketing department they want something to
do with fruit so i wouldn't say the design should be like a fruit but yeah we can take inspiration from fruit colours like the vibrant
colours uh red chilli uh
tomato red or whatever and second thing is cer certain standard buttons we should have like for example i if you see the previous slide uh
i think most of the users would now be well acquainted with this cer central pattern here so we we we would not change h that particular pattern because i this is the most consistent thing in all remote controls
this is central one the one you yeah volume and channel so keep that m that standardised because that's the most common feature across all models if you look at all the models it's here
this
and
voice recognition
the kinetic
mm hmm
maybe we could start with the black and white
that that way we could upgrade later
mm
mm
yeah

and for the sorry
for the body design i think plastic uh w yeah we could use the body for the inside and uh rubber as a padding or for the grip something like to add to the design

plast right
it's
uh i it's different
right
acupressure you could talk of acupressures
and finally the body should be retouchable may maybe ch you can change the body or the case casing the case outside it should be moulded it with the design in such a way you can change it every time
okay the rubber
fine
yeah
fine uh we were talking of voice recognition also because that we are not for how to look it uh remote control if it's lost
so are we looking at voice
or maybe like uh william was suggesting in the last thing some devices you put on key chains
for l yeah the whistle so we can if financially voice recognition is not feasible we could go for a whistle
yep
uh sorry i didn't mention this but we'll be incorporating in the design
fine
mm hmm
yeah
again a questionnaire huh

i think we are pretty going in a clear direction now
i'll wait until you're all um hooked up
okay

put it on in that way thanks
okay
welcome back everybody hope you've had fun
right um this is our conceptual design meeting um i think we're slightly ahead of ourselves
from the last meeting i th i i think yeah um
this is where we talk about um properties materials user interface and trend watching
so i think we've touched on a few things
to do with that already but we'll just go over it
um
the minutes from the last time um we had a couple of
um changes in our plans in that we couldn't use teletext it wasn't gonna be a control
for everything um and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow
um
we have decided on a leaving out the voice recognition
we've decided on there being a flip design and um a
different shape from what's normal we were thinking a shell but something along those lines just a different shape from what's
normal um
you were going to look into the rechargeable batteries
and we were gonna think about the port and an alarm for getting it lost things like that
um and our market was going to be young business
kind of range okay so shall we start with the first presentation yes if
you feel

it's okay
yeah
okay thank you very much um
let's start from the inside and work our way out
i don't think so not yet
um yes thank you
i hate those little things
especially if you do them on too tight and you can't get the leverage on them to undo them
okay
'kay
'kay
wa can you explain that
like a right okay
how what kind of how l long can you get out of that i mean can you pick it up and then wind it for two minutes and then that's it for the night or
that doesn't count though does it
i thought it was u v like
any any
i'm pretty sure that solar is from the sun
uh i don't think it counts electric lights no but i mean not many you don't want to limit your market i mean people who live in basement flats there's not that many people but there are people
mm but then it would be charging through the day i think the point is that it charges through the day and then you've got it charged for the evening
okay
yeah i've seen
but then if you think about a watch it's on your wrist so it's on your whole bod it's on your body the whole time so
you're walking around you're doing things it is moving a lot of the time if you'd i mean you switch the t v on then you put it on the
side then you pick it up to change it and then you put it on the side is it really gonna be enough
okay
so it's not the draw on it isn't
okay
like a dual kind of
expensive as well what kind of price are we looking at for i presume the normal batteries are the cheapest
solar
well they're not designed
practical wise okay
you do get a bit of wear but don't calculators have a battery in them as well
mm
okay can we add in uh an attachment to closing feature
can we think about that 'cause if we're doing the kinetic thing and it's
well add it in to think about um
because
where am i if it is the kinetic thing and it is small and it is
portable and it is a different shape and the kinetic is something people don't do
kind of we're doing something original and different um but if you wore it if it's something you could just clip
on your pocket then you would have that less you you wouldn't lose it so much
but then maybe that's looking at someone who's just sitting on their own rather than
the eternal battle for control of the controls
no
okay
okay right
mm hmm
what kind of things do we have to consider there can we what kind of size does it come in varying sizes or is it just one size and we would have to fit the design of
mm hmm
okay
okay
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm
mm hmm
hinged yeah
so instead of the fascia that comes off being plastic the fascia that comes off would be the rubber like those pens that you get with the grip that you can you can pull that off
okay
mm
well that's been really popular with mobile phones so i don't see why not
'kay
mm hmm
mm hmm
oh it would be flat inside
mm
i think it would be good to have a contrast between if the whole thing is gonna be this rubber thing it
would be good to open it up and see something quite fancy looking inside now how would you distinguish if you had it bare
how would you distinguish where you had to press i mean
uh
like one of the palm pop thing
it would have to be attached
okay we'll talk about that so if you finish your and we'll come back to that that's you right okay
no
we're marketing to guys as much as we are to women
well it's a remote control you were sitting watching t v are you gonna want to sort of open it and say oh shit i should go and have a shower and do my hair before i put the t
yeah no no
mm
okay
okay okay
mm
mm
okay
which means
okay
okay
mm hmm
can we swap that round so th that the ones that we use all the time are on the bottom part
'cause if you're thinking about holding it
you would be using your thumbs to press just like a mobile phone
yeah
that's what i was just saying and then have the and then have the l c d at the top and then be
able to touch that for the other controls so have the um the volume
and the programme things like that on the lower side okay
i can't see that is that play and stop and things
or is that volume and channel
okay
right okay um
i'm not sure how long we've got left but we need to make a decision about um
the things we've discussed
so we agree on
do we agree on the battery
yeah um that means that there's no function for li
the port you know that it sits in then pressing the button then having so we could incorporate voice recognition for the finding
it it's a bi i it's like a g it's a gadget it's a
selling point
i think the only
i think the only pitfall that we would have would be how much it's going to cost if that means we have to cut
down somewhere else but i think pretty much we've used cheap
relatively cheap and simple things the l c d 's not cheap
yeah okay
and you could yeah
okay
do you want like a back up
um okay so we've got battery the inside components is pretty standardised across the board isn't it
so there's not a really a decision to be made there um
the buttons what did you give us as our
the bare board l c d or
on the top one okay you've got the touch okay and then
okay okay
no it's fine
for the inside
mm hmm
oh i think so i think so
no i think i we don't wanna be tacky if we've got a kind of different shape anyway
um the fact the m the material that we would be using would be cheap so we could make it red
we could make it um psychedelic you know we could make it black and
white zebra stripes but that's not really what we're focusing on what we're focusing on is the m you know
yes so we could just pick anything
it's just different it's just different from everything else and i mean i'm trying to imagine
um clean looking houses sort of beige and black um
so you either want something that goes with that which is what's on the market anyway or you want something that contrasts
as you know like you get clocks now that are more of a talking point than an actual clock
because they're so interesting and
mm
and you would just have an across the b you would have so many different options that you could do you could have um a plain black one you could have sparkly pink glittery ones for your little
mm
and ones tha ones that have rubbery spikes y you know you could just go
so far with it like a puffer fish you could just you could take it wherever so i think that's quite a
flexible thing
yes
mm
yeah
okay we've got five minutes um or that might've been up for a while
mm hmm
have you
okay
well they do but i think we can you could well it is it is i think you
just address that with um advertising um you associate the name with the individual product
that it is and that does the work for you obviously it'll have a logo on it just like everything but everything else has a logo
on it the point is that it's got to stand out somehow differently but i think it does without that so i'm not worried
about that
depending on how i i mean we've got this memo saying that it's something that the company's looking into so
um that seems to make sense but if it turns out that it's hugely expensive we'd have to cut down somewhere else then
it's worth thinking about but i think we'll find out more about cost
afterwards right i'm going to wrap it up there
i got a end meeting now message on my mo yeah so um
so i think we've probably got it says closing we have forty minutes so i um think we've probably got about that time before we come back
it's either that or
we only had forty minutes to discuss what we just discussed and don't know how long that took
is everyone happy
okay

yeah yeah i was getting that impression as well
etcetera
yeah
yeah

yeah okay
that screwed in
yeah
'kay
okay um this is uh all about the design of the actual components and the availability of the components we have in stock at the moment okay first uh the
into the method the the main idea of the whole thing is just so you sh you just
press buttons and it should activate things on the t v and we discussed last meeting that it should be easy to find
um also in this study i've looked into the availability of some of the materials 'cause some of the things
that we looked at last time aren't un unfortunately aren't available
um findings i've got my nice little picture there this is uh the chip called the t a double one
eight three five which is what's used in pretty much every remote control 'cause it sends out standard signals
based on your input and um it's pretty much used for all all
t v remotes at the moment um and then we we're loo looking into battery options
there's um actually no rechargeable option available so we i
saw the um the standard double a and triple a which we thought were a bit
bit too bulky at the moment dynamo charging i thought that that might be a bit silly to be to be honest
people won't it's it's basically like wind up radio so you wind up your remote control before you
use it it might
you
yeah yeah oh yeah i presu you wouldn't have to wind it for very long but i don't i don't
think it's really sort of necessary when you th you think of the next two options like
the the solar charging 'cause most people have the light on in the room anyway
so they could get when when you got t v
no
is it alright i
yeah it would the d yeah the dynamo would take more space 'cause you actually need a physical sort of handle to wind up
yeah okay
but
yeah and most people most people also watch t v in the in the night anyway
but i i think i think the the next one's the best anyway the the kinetic charging which is like you get
it in r you get it in wrist watches and you d you don't even notice it i mean the amount
the amount of probably moving around you'd be doing all the time would would charge it up i don't think you'd ever need to actually physically
start shaking it up to make it work
um yeah it's it charges into um some form of it's a smaller cell
which it charges into and uh the si the size sort of a watch a watch battery
'cause they use them quite frequently in watches and that'll that would l would last for
um well i do i d i'm not entirely sure how long it would last but i've never seen one
run out
yeah
yeah and
yeah but then again i i think it is because if you think about it the watch although it's only a tiny
amount it's it's um it's always moving for the whole
day and they don't run out over night when you leave them on the side and th for the
same the same reason you're only using it for a v incredibly short amount of time just to send the signal and then you're
finished with it and you put it no no i do i don't think the the draw on it would be
mm
ye yeah i think i th uh g y you could have a dual um power thing
but the the thing with the solar cells is you would need to put them on the case and they because if you
lie on a calculator they they're qui they're quite big and they all they all look i identical
they're they're expensive they don't
yeah the normal batteries would be the cheapest i'd presume then it would actually be the the solar charging ones um but the
it's i i think they're not very resistant to dropping 'cause if you
drop stuff yeah if you if you have y the size you'd need to charge a remote wouldn't be that big but
i mean if remotes always get thrown around and stuff so
y i think yeah practically
i mean calculators you don't really throw around a lot whereas remotes you do they can t
yeah they do they yeah they've got dual things but they're the batteries are smaller i think
mm w m yeah so the
yeah the the s if you if you had something du uh using the standard
batteries and the solar charging um i don't think you'd i think the it would d well you know how long the standard double a s would last in or triple a s would last
yeah i think i i think it would yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah

okay
okay well i'll move on
um my second part of my findings uh the mo most current remotes
use this silicone uh p c b board which pr printed
circuit board which basically has these contacts that are really close together and then when you press
down on the rubber button it'll connect the circuit and each each switch is connected to
two uh different legs on the chip and so sends a different message and
that then uh gets translated by the chip into a code and then it's fired out of
this l e d in the sequence of l on and off bursts
well
well this the thi the thing about is um
they they can be as big or as small as you want them to be because you can you can print circuit board like that
that it's it's simply spaced like that so you can have fit the n the size of the nine buttons in if you if
you see how thin the tracks are you could you could s you could put them virtually right next to each other
and have a much smaller switch on each one if you if you wanted to but um the
there is an option to do to do it like that or you could have some sort of
array of switches which i'll speak about in the next bit so that
and then to uh yeah so to conserve battery life the remote should be in a standby mode
no while not being used now what i was thinking about that was 'cause sometimes when y when you have
these things they've got little lights on behind the buttons so you can see what all the buttons are like on a mobile phone
they do it more often than on a than on a t v remote but you could you could have lights
behind the buttons and um after like five or ten seconds of not being used i'd have that turned
off if we decided to go for buttons that could light up
um the case material i've a been sent what the
factory can actually give us the there's the plastic which i think
we were gonna go for anyway as the main case case housing and
the the main problems with the well you could go for wood but i think it
would be a bit impractical titanium um very expensive
just to process which to make it is expensive and rubber
well you're saying that people like this uh spongy feel this year so perhaps
uh some something made of rubber but i was thinking more of the buttons because the buttons which
they've they've said
that they've they've put across
are what is used in some stress ball manufacture and it's meant to be anti
r s i i'm no i'm not sure how that would work because surely your fingers would still
be moving over the short distances but that's what they said um the problem
with the casing is that uh there's
quite um there's quite a few design restrictions that they've got on
the shape of the case if you go for titanium they can only do a standard box shape whereas if you come
to plastic they can they can be a little more they can they can do sort of curved shapes but whether
whether or not because we'd have it in two separate units
for the flip phone
yeah
yeah i th
uh
yeah in in titanium i don't i don't think it would be available at all really the ju just it
w well you could make it available in the titanium it was just it would be so expensive to buy a new case
for it because of the expense of how much titanium is is it's light and strong
but i think it should be left for aircraft design rather than for
for a remote
yeah yeah
rubber yeah
and you can peel them off yeah
yeah
yeah
hmm
t
yeah
also the just just going back to the interface designs with the buttons the
i kno we were planning to do some sort of touch screen now what i was saying before
about instead of having you could have just a bare p c b circuit board
and i'm sure you could probably get it in different colours and so just by touching it with your finger it'd make
the connection
over if you had them close enough that would be one option um the second option th
they offer rubber buttons but i thought that an l c d type of screen 'cause
one they're incredibly thin um and don't take up much space two
they you can have them in a sort of array and you can arrange the buttons on the screen
in a sort of set thing and you could have them like a touch
display
uh what what
oh on the on the l c d screen you could becau you could fit it the problem with it basically is
that it's flat and so you can't do lots of curve curved things with it but um
you can you wouldn't have with the l c d you'd have the wires coming off you wouldn't have that
with the
with the l c d you'd only have that with the printed circuit board
with
w also with the
yeah
you could have a flat screen inside yeah but i'm just wondering whether we want an l c d screen inside
it wouldn't be like full colour it would just be black and white but there'd be touch touch buttons
so you wouldn't be pressing down on 'em w or we could have rubber buttons which are made of this material which is anti r s i
is rubber
mm
yeah i hadn't i hadn't really thought of that to be honest
yeah you could you could have some sort of stylus that you could pull out but i i think they could get a bit easily lost 'cause i had
hmm
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah okay
yeah that's yeah that that's the end of m my
yeah
uh yeah
yeah yeah that that would be fairly simple i mean you'd you'd actually have two separate you'd have two separate circuit
boards but they'd be joined by wires or like some cabling between
them 'cause in the in the actual flip bit you'd have some linking
mm
um

yeah
i mean you can you could do it you could have a 'cause if you if you just put the full charge through an l c d display it'll completely blank it out but i don't know if you could get any mirror effect on it i'm not sure about

yeah
yeah
yeah
if you if yeah if you have like buttons that appear on the screen in this l c d screen
yeah
yeah
yeah yeah but you can do it with your thumb li
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
well yeah we
yeah
yeah
mm
yeah i think i mean if
yeah it is it is qui it's quite a cool feature to have and also if they've got it if they've got
these parts already in stock then it won't be cheap to re manufacture them uh or it will be cheap
sorry to re manufacture them so do you reckon that's a good idea that where's the remote
i'm here thing i think that would be quite fun
yeah
yeah
yeah to s th well it's it's not as expensive as it would be if it was full colour 'cause if we've just got a black and white one i mean they use them in calculators so
yeah

well you cou um
k no the kinetic ones come come with um a sort of w watch a battery that goes in a watch
so it's a lot smaller so it would
yeah
yeah the well i think were we're going for the l c d on that one on the buttons on the on the on on the top one we're gonna yeah
on the bottom we were gonna have the rubber the rubber ones the anti r s i ones
um okay on we've got the flip the flip screen the top one is gonna be the l c d and the bottom one is gonna be the rubberised buttons
plastic okay
yeah
mm no
mm

you can you can just
yeah
yeah
yeah yeah j with these rubber these rubberised ca not the actual uh plastic outside case just the rubber thing that goes round the outside

oh yeah yeah the whistle ones yeah
yeah
yeah depending on the expense of it
and they've got in stock so yeah
yeah
okay
did it
oh good grief
'kay
oh
mm
mm hmm
shall i okay we just connect up
thank you
there we go okay um so we decided on our market and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching um
the methods we used to decide on uh
current trends and so on market trends were that we did our traditional uh our usual market research study uh with
a hundred subjects and the the general feedback from them is that the most im
uh w i'm sorry i'm slightly tongue tied after lunch sorry project manager um we decided on the most important aspect
i uh required in a remote control device and we'll come to that later so that was one of the first things we did also with our company
um being forerunners in uh putting fashion into technology we also looked at a fashion update um
using our consultants on fashion and design in paris and milan
uh so the general findings from that was uh in the market trends the most important aspect for remote
controls were people want a fancy look and feel rather than the the
current functional look and feel of remote controls they also also want a remote control to be technologically
innovative
and of course as we predicted that it should be easy to use now i should point out that the first of those findings
fancy look and feel is the most important is twice as important as the second technologically innovative which
is in turn twice as important as being easy to use
so possibly that the feature that we put first is actually third is still important but it's third in order of preference for the
the subject group we looked at okay um now the fashion update which relates
to very personal preferences among our subject group um we found from our um consultants
in paris and milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes
shoes and furniture so should we be thinking of using something like that in our remote control design too
there also seems to be um a trend towards a spongy feel to materials uh again in contrast
to last year so a lot of interesting feedback there both from our market research departments and from our people
in paris and milan be interesting to see what our design people make of that
unless anyone has any questions about that not yet 'kay
okay
i know


does does light charge as as sunlight does artificial light
has to be solar
mm
artificial light no
that's going to
i know different parts of the world too if we're if we're marketing internationally
mm hmm
hmm mm hmm mm could i just ask referring back to solar
charging is that compatible with um standard batteries i mean could people put standard batteries in but with a
s you know they could leave it in the sunlight for solar charging or the two things not compatible
mm
so that affects the exterior design
mm
again it de
mm
it would just detract from the attractiveness of the of the whole feature i it's not gonna add anything okay
shouldn't we do some market research on that first before we add it in because i i personally right okay
it's not something that's come up in any of our uh focus groups and market research it's not a thing that people are looking for
when we threw it open to the field yeah
but it's something to put on the side to think about maybe
mm
okay
mm
mm hmm
it does mark quite easily too if you let it fall i've got a mobile phone myself which is titanium and it does mark very easily if
you drop it i was just wondering if we make the basic mould out of plastic but have like a rubber cover that goes over
that would give the spongy feel that also allows us to kind of have different fasciae for the phone
like a rubber sleeve almost yeah
mm
mm
very cheap way of changing the look of it and people can just buy a new one if they want to
mm yeah
mm
i don't s sorry to interrupt i don't see why the curved thing is a problem if we for example had a shell once we open that yeah so it'd be f yeah yeah
have i misunderstood you
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah
i just had another idea i don't know if it helps with that but just to do with the r s i is it possible just as an option
when we open it up people can use their fingers to press the button or we have inside like a small pointer thing when people want to
mm
yeah they're easy to replace as well cheap
mm hmm
mm
yeah just a thought they wouldn't actually need one and they could use anything they've got couldn't they a pencil or a pen so they wouldn't really need a
mm hmm
i'll just raise another point while it occurs to me it kind of applies to both our designers here so i'm not sure how it would fit in if we
flip open now you know how you've got some mirrors in nightclubs that are mirrors when you turn to them and you turn away
and it gives like an advertising display you seen those
and they kind of respond to the turn of your body is it possible that when we open our flip top shell it's a little compact mirror and when you press a button it then goes onto the phone display th uh the remote control display thing
they don't look at themselves
just a thought
yeah
i know what you mean it's with us using the ideas for a mobile ph it's with us using the ideas for mobile phones i kinda got sidetracked onto that i think okay trying to think of other features we can build in that wouldn't cost too much but maybe we'll leave that one on the side
'kay
mm
oh i think forget about the mirror that was just a very quick passing thought yeah
sorry what does that stand for
okay
no you'd hold it you don't if you flip it open then you'd be
wouldn't you isn't that the idea you us if we just use the shell as an example again you open that you've got your l c d display there and you've got the buttons there so you're holding it in the palm of your hand yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
hmm
mm
mm
kinetic
mm
mm
hmm
yeah we talked about kinetic charging we've deci seem to have decided on that did we decide on double a or triple a batteries
no one of the decisions we had to make was whether we had double a or triple a batteries 'cause they've still got to be charged this way haven't they i oh i see
right okay got you
got you on that okay didn't realise
sorry could you repeat that last part
l c d screen
mm hmm
okay
mm hmm so we decided on a rubber casing for the plastic shell a variety of designs okay
and it is just uh although it's rubberised and spongy apart from that we're just going to go for sort of vegetable and fruit colours we're not gonna try and make it actually a vegetable or fruit design or anything else like a shell that we discussed just go for the colours
okay
mm hmm
the feel
'kay
mm hmm is that going to be this image i've got in my head of something kind of shaped like that maybe about that
size made of plastic fits into the palm of the hand rubberised cover that's spongy
is that really going to fit fancy look and feel which was the major thing that people wanted market research is
that fancy
mm
mm hmm
mm hmm mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah
i'm just kind of pushing at that to see if you came out with anything else but i mean i totally agree we looked at those remotes i mean they are kind of anonymous very similar looking things this would definitely be different enough i just wondered if anybody could come up with something even more
well the thing is the rubberised covers are going to be s relatively cheap to produce that if in a year's time we we get feedback from the design fairs that show something else is coming i mean it's so easy for us to just produce that and it can be slipped on which is another beauty of it


mm so can i just recap uh sarah for the decisions that we've made kinetic charging the watch type
batteries um l c d display on th the top side of the flip top
rubberised buttons on the bottom side we're gonna use fruit and vegetable colours for the rubber cover the case itself is plastic
that's how far we've got what else do we have to add to our decisions here
mm
yes it was just there was just a cost issue with that but it's a good idea we just need to check on the cost is that right
and incorporating the company logo
mm 'cause i took it from the feedback you gave in the last meeting from y from y your report it's not just a case of having a little r r hidden somewhere they do want it to be obvious that it's our product don't they
since it's the only one of its kind on the market it's obviously gonna be ours
yeah
okay
okay
okay did we i know at the last meeting we spoke about a beeper i think that was you talked about a beeper for a location have we just rejected that in favour of voice recognition then


you got to go through
hmm
thank you
hmm hmm
yep me too
mm hmm
yep
me and william worked on a prototype and i think william is going to make a p presentation on that
yeah
i can hold it like
yeah so

it looks
crazy
um not now
oh
yeah
oh where are the hinges
'kay
you able to look
yep

the black and white touch screen wherein people can
right


mm hmm

'kay
ah oka
infrared could be here also yeah here
so when it's even if it's open here the signals would go yeah

this one right here
which is
no
look up to it
yay
so this is the one sorry
evaluation
mm um i i think this is chip
mm hmm
mm hmm
ah it's perfect
is it everybody is going to evaluate or just the market okay
'kay
yeah so you can
'kay
i would say four mm hmm
almost three
i think yeah
oh sorry i i got it wrong the first one rating i'm sorry can you just make it two
the first yeah i i just it the other way
uh in
yep i just got

two point f
one is a seven is false okay
two
two

white with for the plastic uh blue
any
right
mm hmm
yeah because you'll be having a
because of the rubber case
one
mm
four

voice r recognition



hmm
you want me to b unplug that
that's all yes
okay
chip on print
okay
yep
single curved
two curves yeah
single cu
plastic and rubber
yeah plastic one and maybe rubber point five
no i think rubber since it's being used just as a casing we can put point five
yeah because there are
i think it allows the point five yeah we can use that
it means we are not using a lot of rubber actually we're using just
a very low quantity of rubber compared to plastic
push button
one
an
one
i think we could change the battery also instead of going for kinetic how about going for a standard battery
uncurved flat
no it just surprises one
i don't think so
ri i think it's in euro
and going to a regular bat
yeah
what i feel is customers never said anything about the battery it's internal nobody looks into the battery but shape and colours that's something we shouldn't comprimi
where's that special form
mm mm mm

mm hmm
make it costly
yeah we are close to the budget
two five
it's twelve point five maybe then
i don't know what it said fifty percent of the cost so half of the price would be
i think it is the first one
so we are under the budget
seems fine
except voice recognition everything is
yeah
mm hmm
yeah
i think we had a nice time
yeah i think there was uh very constructive feedback by everybody it's not like people trying to cut each other there is more of uh true cohesive teamwork we came to a very predic creative design yeah
yeah and uh
yeah i think and sarah you coordinated the work very well


yeah
i think that was the best part of the
'kay

yeah moving around the room but i think it's good like uh we spent times individually
i never thought of a remote control with a flip top

that's mine
yeah it's
the thing is
yep sorry go on sarah
surprising to me is like uh people give a lot of attention to modifying mobile phones like a real
want to see a new launch or something like that and new f television products coming up but nobody giving uh
much idea to this like sarah was telling everything's
right
mm hmm


maybe fifty percent more
yeah
who knows

yeah
there's a final questionnaire
celebration you didn't talk about that

yeah
if you leave them on the whole time you get to look like a noodle the whole time
is that
three apparently
okay you all switched on
i presume we're good to go okay um
minutes um we decided to use a kinetic charger
standard chip um 'cause it can come in various different sizes it wasn't uh
uh gonna be a problem factor we wanted a stand by function the case material is gonna be
soft rubbery changeable um buttons with a combination of l c d and rubber
according to the design um bright funky designs inspired by fruit keeping with the
hip kind of feel um and to try and incorporate voice recognition software
into our design until we can find out more about the cost of things like that um and
the rubber buttons that we'll use will be anti r s i okay
prototype presentation
i think that would be you
make sure the camera's
yes yes you can wait a second i'll get it out
um
okay
you should have one of those things and you can just take it off ta da

right
mm 'kay
mm hmm
okay
mm so it's flush
oh right okay yeah
so put it in the top section rather than the bottom sections 'cause it's the top part that's okay
okay i'm under the sofa
or that would be too complicated
infrared
like here
okay actually no it would be it would have to be on the on the front oh right yeah okay yeah i've got you
it's still pointing yes
yeah that would make sense
okay
but not interfering with the outside kind of look of the product once it's
okay
thank you very much
wrapping it all up okay um i've now got evaluation criteria
it's to be presented okay

it's quite similar to what it was before though
sorry
mm hmm
okay
just write small
yeah that works
mm hmm
i would agree
okay
i would say two
a two
it's just two point five for that one
i would say a two i would say a two
one point seven f five okay mm hmm
mm hmm
one
well the type of button that we're gonna use in the bottom half the material minimises r s i it's meant to um
maybe because it's slightl with the size that we've got it's quite small but with the amount of stuff we're putting on it isn't that much so maybe because there's more space it's not kind of moving around trying to
hit accurately the buttons in between it's quite obvious just big buttons um
four
a standard
it would be
and if you didn't hear it in the room that you were standing in then you'd realise that it wasn't in that room you'd go into another room
one

i don't think so
i think we yeah i think we're set
do much apart from having a huge big
don't think so
okay thank you
okay i've got finance here now i'm gonna plug this in so you can all see it if that's okay
um
thanks
right
now i presume
that the screen will go blank
that um
okay we just type numbers into this and we come out with the final value so are we still on for kinetic
okay see it woulda been handy to have this at the beginning um it might have influenced our choice
right what's happening with the electronics
double curved
oh right okay
thanks
so would there be two
one chip
okay
one double curve
so what's a single curve then
so just one double
yeah um
mm
um we've got plastic and rubber haven't we
um
do you think
okay
it would be like saying we're using
see it says case material
so we're not actually using plastic in the case are we it's including it's including
okay we'll just put it in as we'll put in as half
or sh we should just put it in as one because the plastic is zero anyway
no we don't step on anyone's toes okay special colour do we need that
n yeah okay
interface
buttons
has that not gone up oh no it was seven five it's changed not a lot

oh it's not calculated it
okay there we go
it's not a lot though
we haven't been dealin we haven't been dealing with dollars though i think
okay so the highest we've got is the electronics here
um
and the interface
where's the
where's the voice recognition
right okay
well the kinetic is three if we change it to the battery it's that's minus three
oh right i keep seeing zero
um
we can do it some other way we can do it doesn't have to be voice recognition we could do the voice recognition for you know business class or something you know like an upgraded version you could choose to have that or not
so should we just change the design specification then
yes
mm hmm
mm hmm
okay we can
make the price fit and then say if we'd had our budget we would've had this
because it also sets it apart from the crowd they like their gadgets they like something that's completely different
it's s something completely different associated with your company right okay so
it's two point five no it's twelve point two five
yeah well two twelve point two five times two is
twenty five isn't it
i think the agenda one was where the um price was wasn't it no
twelve point five

well done people
so is that uh got us covered for the electronics then we don't need something else to take that place okay
okay
right so we've done that
okay product evaluation
we've done room for creativity haven't we because we've got decisions that we would have made that we weren't didn't feel able to make um
i presume we discussed leadership and teamwork
um in the sense that
um did you feel like a team or did you feel like uh autonomy
mm hmm

thank you how did you find it
yeah
yeah i liked the fact that we could say an idea and it'd be
suggested that that wasn't the best idea but no one felt like shot down you know y it didn't matter it saying
what you thought because if it wasn't something that was that relevant then it didn't matter 'cause it was just another idea in the
field i like that um
teamwork well you two created that wonderful specimen of a play doh model
um uh i'm still not caught up but that's nothing to do with the teamwork at all um
maybe
no that was quite fun um means whiteboard digital pens etcetera what does that mean any ideas
had time to kind of
yeah 'cause we could just sort of say sorry what did you say about that or what do you think about that rather than having to email it yeah but it was nice having it there
um like the whole picture of the thing
yeah i think it's new ideas in general rather than
mm

yeah no well they have to come from somewhere don't they
and as sh as w sorry you go um as was shown by your presentation with all
of the other controls remote controls no one's thought about it particularly i mean they're slightly
different so if someone's been shut in the room and said make ours a bit different from everyone else's 'cause it's w something we should think about
but obviously no one's put any great deal of thought into it
mm
but then when it everything is really smart and you've just got this big chunk of black thing sitting
on your coffee table it doesn't go i mean if you could have something that's a proper funky thing
a funky item that's individual individual to you i mean they could even go into um you
go in with an idea and they design it on photoshop and then they just get it printed on the plastic you would pray you would pay
a lot extra because it's individually being a plastic was being made for you
but people could have anything that they wanted
because of the produ
mm
yes
yeah
well it's innovation for money's sake the the people have to keep buying yeah
and you can't get you've got your handset that works fine but you can't get the battery anymore for that type of phone because the phones have moved on things like that yes
it's madness um
in closing
there we go um our costs are below budget with recommendations that they the budget be increased but i think i don't know d what do you think do you think that's takes into account um
overheads
like us being well paid kind of a thing and the heating for the building do you think our budget includes everything all the costs that are going out
so it looks well it looks like it's gonna be fifty percent profit you've still got all of the overheads to come out
of that so maybe increasing it you would also have to increase the price that it's sold
at but i think but you were saying that that's quite
hmm
yeah
mm
yeah
it's a shame it won't ever get made maybe it will maybe someone'll r run down and patent it
um the project has been evaluated well and truly um and
we've got the meeting survey and questionnaire oh so we've got about fifty minutes to
catch up with everything that i fell behind with so i'll be delegating in my um role as
project supervisor so good luck
i think the celebration is the twenty five pounds
either that or we'll be dancing on the desks
oh
um yeah just the last i think
i think i've got minutes for two of the meeting and the
last thingy
i just got con
is that for us
okay
yeah shall i show i'll show though do you do you wanna do you wanna sh do you wanna hold it and i'll i'll show you the presentation can i just nick your
whoa
going a bit crazy over here
thank you
okay so this is our look and feel presentation the final our final presentation and we'll first look at the exterior of what we've uh come up with over there um
it's gonna have a a plastic body um with a sort of standard colour
either we're thinking some something fairly neutral like a a white or a light blue or
something this is underneath the rubberised the rubberised uh outer casing
um which there'd be sort of a wide choice they would be attached but we can we can come up
with that um the um wide choice of colours and sort of patterns
so you've got you've got a lot of customisation with it um it's obviously
an a sort of clam shell design and uh the um
the top l c d screen that you can see that would b would be sort of um
how do you say it's yeah yeah it would be sort of inset into the into the top and the buttons
at the bottom would d so so it'll fully close flat yeah yeah
and working on the inside we've um already said d decided on the kinetic batteries
which actually thinking about it now could y could also probably attach to the flipping open and shut
as well so that you could probably get a bit of
yeah yeah um we decided that um
the voice recognition system it did actually say on the email that they were sort of coming in
and they were fairly easy to get a hold of so we presumed that they'd also be quite cheap so you'd have something like where
you'd shout out where where is the remote and
it'll shout back i'm here or something
and then yeah it wo it won't shout out i'm here or something it'll just shout out
i'm here or something to similar effect uh yeah if it was going like
i d well tha that could be something for next time maybe you can have a remote that tells you exactly
where it is um the standard there's be a standard transmission with the t v using using
all the standard chips that we've talked about um it would it would have obviously 'cause it's split
over two two different layers it would need two separate p c b s so it would be joined at the hinge
through some sort of cabling and uh because
obviously all t v s use this the same infrared medium we'd just be using
using the same thing to transmit the data and the infrared
um sender would be on the on one of the bot the bottom layer just at the front of the we haven't i don't think we actually put it on
yeah yeah something like that
yeah on the front on the front side of that yeah
so when you've actually got it open it would be facing the t v and then finally um on to the
interface the top screen as we said is would be an inset
um black and white l c d s touch screen which yeah would
uh have all of all of the the available functions for for the remote
on it uh whereas the bot the bottom screen would just contain the standard buttons like the
vo volume up and down channel up and down power on and off and uh
things to that effect and now we've we also decided on the
inside we could possibly either have um some some kind of
sort of bezzled
uh logo on it or something inset or maybe an engraving of the logo on the top
no d not not actually no not uh interfering with l the whole look of the the product when
it's uh on the thing and finally that's how we put the fashion back into
electronics as that is that's the company logo
there you go
yeah



yeah okay
yeah
yeah i'd uh yeah i'd probably put it uh two yeah two or three no three three
mm yeah
yeah yeah
i'd give it a one
no no not at all
yeah
two
two

yeah
d
one
yeah
yeah that's
no no the the base colour was um white or or like or l sort
of a light blue but the changeable fa faces would uh allow you to get any basically
any one of a number of colours that uh th it's full sort of customised
yeah yeah yeah and
no no 'cause th that's that's the the spongy feel would be in the rubber that you put round it that otherwise it's just sort of hard plastic
yeah i'll give it a one as well
yeah
mm
no
yeah
it's meant to be


yeah
yeah i'd uh i'd f i'd go for a five actually 'cause
yep
yeah yeah it was it was uh a voice voice recognition yeah
yeah yeah that yeah that's feasible
um i think it would r
i think it would probably be a a stand it would be a stand it would be quite loud so it would be s p yeah
yeah
yeah one
i do realise that we might be being fairly biased 'cause it is our product but


w i thin yeah i think yeah
mm
no



yeah
it was a regular chip on print and
oh no no no the um
yeah it's you you've put in three for the number of kinetic cells there should just be one
in the top it's the number of c yeah
yeah and yeah just a no one reg v uh
yeah one of them and one sample sensor and sample speaker
and they're double curved no y
two 'cause it's two
yeah i'd say i'd say it was w yeah i think i think it's
one double curved
and one no 'cause one yeah one's double curved and then the other one's
a plastic
yeah
and special colour
yeah
yeah
no no that's it's as an extra
so that shouldn't that shouldn't be actually on there because that's not incorporated in the cost of the remote you get

yeah okay
yeah the push button's one and l c display one
and buttons
well yes
yeah
no we'll have
no no you've got to click off to calculate it again
c it might uh you might you might be assuming that that is in euros it could be
in dollars and then it would be fine because the exchange range would make it about twelve
no
yeah the standard it um it would make one difference the biggest one would be taking away if you took away
if you to
yeah
if if you take away the voice i i do i don't like to say it but if you take away the voice recognition then you've got it
yeah i yeah no 'cause it's samples sens sample speaker if you took away that that'll make it twelve point three five
they n n yeah but you p minus three plus two
yeah but they but i mean in i don't see why we have to sell it for twenty five euros now because they w they were saying they were quite willing to pay more for better product
yeah
we c we could s
yeah we could say
yeah i s
and then say we recommend
yeah
yeah
that'll do it twelve point three five is it twelve point fif was it twelve point fifty
ah
okay
yeah
no 'cause that that was just a bought on extra you could just take that out
and that would be fine yeah
yeah i think that's brilliant
yeah
yes
yeah i'd say as a team
yeah
find out from each other yeah
yeah

yeah no i thought it it went really well and i yeah i i feel that everyone
was listened to and all the points that were raised seem to have been
sorted out although we didn't quite make the voice recognition in there but that's that's good
i think it would have made it into the final product if it was actually if if if we'd seen the marketing before
the initial specification was put out i think maybe it would've come out a d little different
but yeah
yeah
mm

yeah well



discuss which ones yeah
yeah
yeah i think i think we probably woulda used the outer email system more had we actually
had had more time and if we'd been separated more
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
vegetables
yeah
no
yeah i do i don't think the the companies are really concerned they're just like we've got
a d v d player does anyone remember the remote control can't you get the one that we used for the last one yeah
just jazz it up a bit uh d they don't really think about it because normally the remote control isn't the product
which they're trying to ship they're trying to ship the d v d player the video player the t v
yeah
yeah
no
yeah
yeah
yeah
mm
yeah
yeah


well
i think that was just the the physical
yeah
yeah
yeah i think yeah i don't from the market research
no
yeah it was

i it's top secret um it's it is it's a conspiracy going on here that's what it is

in your yeah


okay is that it then
awesome
was that not the questionnaire for the how you felt you'd done in your
thing
i don't think yeah the the s yeah i think yeah questionnaire seven was the one i did just before the meeting
mm
is that someone's
okay
or something

well done
certainly
logged in thank you oops
okay this stage of the evaluation is really for us as a team to evaluate
if we have now got a product specification and prototype design that meets the the
criteria that we got from our market research so this is the first stage of the evaluation
now the collection of the criteria as we saw in our previous meeting was based on the user requirements and trends found in
the marketing reports and marketing strategy of our company so it's what we've discussed in the last meeting are we actually meeting
those trends and requirements
now the findings that we came up with just a recap are here the criteria that we want in this remote control are a fancy
look and feel technological innovation it should be easy to use it should incorporate
current fashion trends and those the two main ones they were the spongy texture and the fruit and vegetable strong design
colours the design should minimise r s i and be easy to locate and
we were still um uh slightly ambivalent as to whether to use voice recognition there though that did seem to be the favoured strategy
but there was also on the sideline the though of maybe having a beeper function
okay so we can come back to that slide if you don't have a note of those i'll just show you how we're going to evaluate
our own feedback to this to what we have so far we're going to use a seven point scale where one
is true and seven is false we look at each of those criteria that i've just mentioned i'll call that slide back up and
i will just do a preliminary rating of all those criteria on the whiteboard here does that seem clear
any questions there
so we're going to look at these crite
yes we're going to come to w we'll discuss each one and we'll come to a consensus rating between one and seven is that okay one is true seven is false
right so i won't write all of that out again it will just be criteria one two three four five
six or a b c d e f to confuse it with the number rating b c d e
f this is where i realise how tiny i actually am
criteria
and rating
actually it might be an idea if we each did give our own individual rating and we could take an average at the end how about that okay so i'll just separate the ratings by obliques and if we go one two three four we know who's who
okay criteria a the fancy look and feel how do we feel
about this prototype model relating to fancy it is a fancy look and feel one is true seven is false
my own rating for that would be a two
one is true and seven is false
i'll just go this way
two
okay
two
a four okay adding those up we've got a six and a five eleven divided by four is what uh two and three quarters it that right two and three quarters
okay
two point seven five there we go okay criteria b criterion b technologically innovative
i would give that a three
okay not that you're biased in that it the designer
the average oh for you you want your rating to be a two
is that what you're saying okay
so i'll work out the average for that again at the end it's a very slightly altered
okay and we're just waiting for your rating f
two point five okay
losing one decimal place that's okay
so what are you rating for this one paw two okay
so that is eight that brings it down to two nice and simple yeah
okay ease of use easy to use
based on what you've said there i would say a one true
two
a two okay
two
i should've said a two to make the arithmetic easy shouldn't i we'll just put almost two because
i'm not gonna get into silly decimal places okay or we or if we want to really bring it down we can do later
um mm now we're looking at it incorporates current fashion trends now
that's particularly in relation to our market research findings about the spongy texture to the exterior
and the fruit and vegetable design colours
right so i'm just thinking before i give it my rating you were limited in the use of materials for your prototype here is this actually going to be the colours that you would use
right
so we could use any strong fruit and veg colours and that's what we're intending to do okay and the spongy feel is no problem with that
okay
in that case it's got to be a one for me
yep everybody okay
that part was nice and easy okay uh moving on to does the design minimise repetitive strain injury
i don't think we've really touched on that a lot we've we've discussed it we haven't really come up with anything that
we felt could feasibly reduce that we've talked about pointers but the very use of a remote control if you're someone who's zapping who's sitting like that and we found so many people did how do you minimise that on such a small device
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm
mm hmm
right
right i think i'm gonna have to be neutral on that and give it a four
a five okay
four and a four okay
twenty one is that twenty one so that's four point two five
and finally last but not least easy to locate now we talked about voice recognition we talked about a beeper have we really have the designers come to any dec real decision on that
it was the i'm here thing yep and are we happy with the costs on that that is going to be feasible cost wise
that sounds good then i'd go for a i ca we can adjust the volume on that just as we could volume on t v
so if sombody's in the other room or if t v s in different rooms or
right okay you built into the feature
okay
logical that's a one for me
one and one good
so how do we feel about this we've got our our we've got the highest rating of meeting the specifications
that is definitely true for two of the uh six criteria there that is for
um incorporates current fashion trends and is easy to locate the lowest rating we've
got which is really n it's not terribly low i it's close around neutral is for uh the minimisation of
repetitive strain injury do we feel on the basis of tha of these evaluation findings
that we can go ahead and now produce this as a prototype and market it or do we have to make further modifications
we happy to go ahead
yeah i think for most of those ratings that it's high enough at the upper end of the scale for us to go ahead with that and i really doubt if
on the basis of current technology and our current capabilities we could actually do much more to minimise that
i know okay well i hope that's uh clear to the team is there anything you would like to to ask me about the findings before i
sum up
good fine then i'll just leave it there oops
oh yes
yes
but it has a slightly flattened bottom so it can sit so it can rest
it would just be a flat bottom with one curve like a domed thing
mm
the other curves at the sides but it's slightly flattened at the bottom so it doesn't roll over yeah
what does it mean if you put point five for that
mm hmm
right okay
but it is gonna be part of the total cost and there's nowhere else we can we can put that in is there there's nowhere else we can code for the the rubber used in the casing so do we not have to account for it in the cost somewhere there
okay
mm
might do if we go for some of the more exotic aubergines and such like colours
s
has that not made any d if you click off that square now has that not made any difference is it oh it's brought it slightly down
so is is uncurved completely and just actually making the rubber case the curved thing is that going to make a difference
oh it's not made any difference has it it's gone up again
oh
it's brought it down slightly
is there anything on the menu
no
if we tr um
if we moved away from our much loved idea of a kinetic battery and just went with the standard batteries would that make a huge difference
and people are used to buying batteries they're not gonna say i'm not getting this 'cause i've got to buy a battery for a remote control
should we see what difference it makes
um
yeah
sure
but we're still working to um head o
we can put in our recommendations if we if we're working to head office specifications as this is what this project team's working
for we can put in our recommendations for what we've we've found and what we the consensus that we've come to as a result of the meetings but we need
to work to that specification to start with and i think the voice recognition sounds wonderful but our object is so
distinctive that that in itself is gonna make it easier to locate as a f you know in a first instance um
as you say we can offer the voice recognition initially to business class customers and so
mm
yeah
'cause we've done all the background work to go for that if they want it
yeah
so if we take voice recognition out
we are
are you sure sorry not meaning to doubt your words there
right are they really going to quibble about ten p
or point zero one of a euro which is less than ten p
that's today's
kick off meeting
mm i thought that's what it was
so we're okay
although we had our separate tasks there was so much interaction so much that we needed to um bounce off each other
and i've certainly felt heard listened to in that in relevant areas we've been able to you know
give and take and adjust our remit where necessary
yeah


maybe we should think of branching out into children's toys and fake mobile phones as a side line and fake r c s
how do we evaluate the materials we had for communicating and sharing information
could it've been better was it adequate
mm
yeah
yeah
it's really borrowing from other areas it's you know bringing things from other areas in it so it's i mean nothing is new but it's applying it to a d in a different area


absolutely yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah
yeah
yeah the focus isn't on to that yeah

i think it's really good that this has been very market research based because just going
back to mobile phones i mean this is the first change in remote control devices that i can really you know say is is obvious and visible
we see it in mobile phones a lot and tha that's where we've borrowed a lot of our ide our ideas from there are innovations in that that people don't
really want i see people wanting a model of the phone they were really happy with and they can't get it anymore and it's innovation for innovation's
sake and i think it's wonderful our company's so r and d based
yeah but forcing it onto people yeah it's things that you know they might want to buy the thing they really want
mm mm
or there isn't a cover to fit it or whatever yeah
see i think
i think it was just the produc uh just the production cost of the phone
mm hmm
but i think in the remit that we were given it was very specific i think we've done what we were required to do and i think there'll have to be another project team or a new project for us to look at at those kind of things i don't think that's something we have to look at and find a way of raising the cash for
i think we've done very well to get within budget and it still makes such an innovative item that i think people are really gonna want
i know maybe it will maybe they are gonna steal our ideas and sell it

mm hmm

questionnaire
questionnaire done
oh i didn't have to rate you on how much you influenced the meeting this time
oh right but do we not sometimes evaluate in these meetings too yeah


did we get seven out of ten for the other one


okay
yep

not bad

um i think there is just because um the
the topic box and all this is um is based on um oh what's it called
nom no nite text area or something in text area is that what it is um
it has some sort of highlighting stuff there so you should probably look at the
um
i'm not sure if it's in built though to be honest
what what what wh wh

you don't okay i'll do it yeah i w i was thinking about uh i was going that direction anyway
yeah that
okay yeah so
okay yeah i see what you mean i think i think
so um i uh have you already calculated all this data or are you supposed to do that oh right
alright
uh what should it come back as
numbers
oh yeah
um whatever you give me i can do it i think i mean um
um
um so what will whenever we open a window for one speaker um
yeah yeah sh pretty much i would have thought
yep yep definitely
oh is it
um the one present although we could do th mm we could do the one highlighted i suppose
mm
mm hmm
i mean that would um that would be um implementing what you said that you wanna see per topic
you wanna see which one spoken most something like that so you could you could zap through these topics
uh meetings sorry and um and it would come up with how much they spoke and you can pick the one that s looks
the most interesting so do you wanna do that then

yeah yeah yeah definitely
so yeah random things like just like return talking time or
yeah good
yeah i mean
can you put in there what topic was spoken about as well then i could use that for the for the topic pop up window
that'd be r
that wasn't what
yeah
yeah because at the moment if you right click on a topic window on one of the topics you have the option of pop popping open a window which gives you a list of all the meetings containing that topic so
yeah
yep
so how how would you d how would you calculate that would you do the summarisation as you populate it you know just yeah for the global
oh right so oh so that that is all sta stored together oh right okay okay
sounds good so have you done these yet the no mm just gotta decide on what we wanna
um yeah definitely yeah so it's all all usable now can i do it tonight
hmm
oh i see
yeah well let me know when when it's sort of usable or at least
what do you mean a picture do you mean just the yeah but it's not gonna take very long i mean it's m yeah
mm
hmm
sounds good so where is that is that stored in the uh
on your home directory not in the okay
yeah
sounds good
alright
yeah well are you wanting to write that in directly or what what do you wanna do with that if you wanna change my code
you're yeah but are you do you wanna change that m the original m browser file then or yeah
have you done that now or
oh okay so not the actual one but a copy of it

okay yeah no i just
well just just tell me when because i usually i usually work on my own copy for for the day and then update it without checking if th if the one in the one in the shared one has changed so okay
yeah let me know
yeah
cool


so is that what you're working on now then to in to rip to present the results nice overall
you mean the hi highlighting stuff or
yeah actually for um um for an n text area whatever it is
um they they defined some ha handy highlights on that so you've got different different
highlights you've got just look at the the what they wrote about it they've got like user highlights
um selection highlights time highlights and
something else
so you can quite easily if your text area is called area you just do area dot set highlights or something you know something like that
that's the way i did it to to highlight to cross highlight between topic and then transcripts
sorta thing
really really
oh yeah allocates more dat more room or whatever more memory
does it talk to you now does it yeah
spent too much time in front of it i think mm right well i've been uh i've been doing some random pop up
windows for the speaker characterisation which is good so i can feel that in now the windows are all there now after
lots of fiddling
well you know just the pop uh pop up window was difficult enough because um it it
m basically has to set up um like whatever ten pop up windows in memory as
in already initialize them because there's there might be ten speakers that all have to have different mee windows
and um and i'm working on when you
click on a topic to see a list of the of the topics of of of the meetings that that topic was mentioned in
and i have uh a question about the we said we wanted a start screen
what kind of start screen do we want i mean do we want some general blurb about welcome to
the browser or something
some animation dancing on

yeah so do we want yeah maybe we could write an on like the whatever it's called the the top of the window saying welcome to the meeting browser
yeah but how m i mean at the moment the way it is it's uh it's a drop down menu as you've seen
um with all the and that because it's it's the dialogue
class that you use there
yeah i mean i think they should have two options either load up a meeting that they choose or do a search and through that once you've got the results you click on something and that loads up the first
oh does it oh
oh ju just bec mm
oh
can you not get this nom object um
i suppose we wouldn't wanna use yeah we yeah we wouldn't wanna use n x t at the beginning anyway because we don't wanna search um locally we wanna search globally so d so let's say
well no then they would open the meeting first right so let's say they have two options either pick one meeting or search globally to find a meeting that they like
yeah
no but why do we want default i mean just you know
yeah but local search we can't do global search without anything pretty much
yeah i mean the local
yeah but yeah the the global um inverted file search gives the nom objects basically to the local search right
well yeah th that's always gonna be the case with search
mm

i mean you can uh you know the option is to do a search in the way that you d if you do a global search
first as a first step and you return the meetings as in they're not even the meetings but the name of the meetings so
you know say you wanna search for the word language then it gives you as a result all the
meetings that contain the word language and then you can decide well i wanna search on this and this and this meeting or only on this
meeting or
yeah
definitely yeah

there is um yeah in the in in one of the papers they have m um names
such as um better understanding or whatever even w one of them is
yeah one of them is even even better understanding or something i i love that yeah
i love that
yeah yep
so i've yeah i've put that in already to
sort of
so yeah again concretely to the start up start up um libraries window
um
well can i
yeah how is that i mean do you think you would have have time for that as well
wha what does t f i d f stand for

oh okay
yeah ah
so the general score would that be a um for the whole of the language or the for all the whole of the corpus okay okay well you know you can you might have some general frequencies
oh i see
so what would the if we had the these fake topics what what would the what would they look like a bunch just a list of like three words or something
alright because that would be really handy then we can actually test it on the user
as opposed to just doing it and not using it 'cause if you just have the segmentation that's great but we can't
we can't compare it to the to the uh hand annotated you know the hand segmented tool
hmm mm
hmm
yeah that would work that'd be really nice
mm yeah yeah definitely
yeah that's what i'm thinking too yeah well do we want to do we want to
sort of but then the main idea was more like to to speed it up speed the search up because n x t over the over the whole of the corpus was just not feasible but it would be
no but the general inverted file oh yeah yeah yeah yeah that would just be a nice extra
yeah i i wasn't sure if it was or not true it's true so what it's only interim
yeah i mean if you have time do that as well that'd be really nice yeah 'cause i mean then then it would
give you like if you searched for a word it would give you the the meetings but also how often the w that word occurred
in that meeting that would be so useful yeah yeah exactly
yeah yeah
yeah but it would be useful if you yeah you know you c if you have a if if you search for language and you return like you know basically all of the meetings you wanna see where they actually spoke about it and where they just mentioned it once
ah
language and
no just like edinburgh and language alright
and then and then ad add those up or something or what how would you combine them that's the question
so to come back to the start up screen i'm i'm i'm
i'm very unsure about what that should look like i mean we wanna for the part where you can choose choose the
the meeting what kind of information do you wanna have about the meeting i mean the u the the longer name obviously if there is one
'cause they don't all have a longer name what the users that spoke the users that took part
but then that's probably pretty much the same for the same group
yeah i'm not sure
yeah just to give them an idea general idea what there is and so they can pick a a to um a meeting
yeah
yeah or w you kn yeah i wanna look at the meeting where so and so spoke um of that you know sort of some sort of research group i want that first meeting look at that
oh oh
mm i don't think we need that yeah because we we just wanna have a way of of yeah because as soon as they've got loaded their first meeting y they can they can browse through that quite nicely
yeah
what do you mean
w how how are we gonna know that
have a user model
but that would defy the whole point of browsing right if you only wanted to look at like five meetings well
you just you just uh you just scroll down the list and find your favourite
one i mean it's not like they come back every day and do the same browsing
let's see what's changed today
mm
yeah yep

oh right oh okay
well
yeah no that's um
i w i wasn't gonna put any you know any any help in there any sort of a explanation of how the browser works to be honest i wasn't oh right
mm hmm i see
but i mean the main thing what you wanna do is to view a meeting right
yeah or search yeah s and both of those we have and
yeah that uh all happens for the search basically basically either the user wa knows which meeting he wants to look at and he just clicks on it or he doesn't and then he searches for one that sort of looks like
yeah
oh i see what you mean inside the search menu yeah
mm hmm
yeah that's that's what yeah
mm hmm yeah that looks about right um but i'm i'm unsure about how
to how to put all the information in there because we need drop down menu but we want all the
information about the name the longer name and the sp and the users so how d how d
no but the codes i mean at least maybe if they know the codes and in or the to in or the corpus corpi
yeah drop down is definitely not
yep yep yeah but then yeah as i said how do you do it
um
no no no i'm not i'm not saying you can you can pick a user but you should come up with some list but
an extended list of the of the meetings so you know you have b d r whatever it was called o one
and then it gives you the longer name blah and then it gives you the you know the participants
i was thinking that yeah tool tip but then yeah uh no it's not at all
i think a tool tip yeah i've not tried that yet but i was i was gonna do that i'm very yeah
very keen on that yeah yeah i'm not sure what th it is that very is that
not annoying if you have to hold your m you know you ha you have t yeah y yes
they do that a lot don't they no but you know to to search for a u pecif pec specific user you have to
hold your mouse over that one wait for it to pop up hold your mouse on that one wait for the pop um
hmm
mm
yeah it'd just be nice to have some basic information on on each of the meetings yeah i'm thinking that that updates
depending on what you've got highlighted yeah maybe that's the best idea then so you've got a drop down menu
a search a search button not search go button
and then
some sort of field which updates dynamically depending on what you've got highlighted
yeah yeah that sounds good
i think
nom yeah what does nom actually stand for
nite oh yes
oh
oh yeah you've got lots of nom something and then nite something and then n something
oh really oh oh
no in most of the descriptions are hints to each other saying you've gotta update this jonathan this is this is uni unintelligible great i know it is
yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah yep definitely not very fun right so anyone else got anything to say
do we yeah do we want another meeting at the end of the week um with pernilla
yeah yeah something like that i mean uh i think i'm gonna do quite a bit of work this week so i'll have probably more to talk about
i think yeah
well
if you like well we can disc uh discuss that on friday if we have one
friday what what time
um
i've got a doctor's appointment at ten to two
what li
w how about qui
i can't
um what i oh no no that that would only give us like thirty five minutes or something well what how about quite late like you know five or six
well three o'clock let's say three o'clock for now
okay
right i'll write um i'll write this meeting up and i'll send it to pernilla as well
no because she's not here
i collect meeting summaries yeah
no we should probably do that at end depending on
so can we just can we just r repeat briefly what we've spoken about so we've din done uh
progress on the speaker characterisation who does the speaker characterisation we've mentioned
topic labelling with uh key words um we discussed
if the search should be ranked and michael did you have anything else
and a start up window
oh well basically not not unless you've got time for at the end it would be nice at the end
i think it would yeah i think i think it w it would it would give you the most relevant result
no but for things like if you search for language then you might have you have some topics which have as a
you know n some some meetings which have as a topic language they specifically speak about language and they use that word
like in every sentence and then you've got those that just mention you know mention it briefly like once or twice saying
you know my language is german or something stupid that you don't really want so you wanna distinguish those somehow
or would be nice anyway
yeah yeah
uh for multiple terms we can just do something really simple i mean
yeah
yeah just just just disregard it yeah yeah i mean you'd you'd just do it really simply you know you'll have the results as before but yeah yeah can discuss it on friday
it doesn't have to be all intelligent
yeah exactly
mm
well it's not that many meetings so that sh that shouldn't is there really wow ooh
hmm yeah that's true
it would be useful as well for a word like language that might occur in all of them but you wanna find the one that actually contains it usefully somehow
you know you still wanna be able to search for for the word language
in a sensible way
well we'll discuss it again on friday
yep yep tick

oops does it squeeze in aye like that yeah
okay
right
yep it's going uh
okay
sure
just said the same things you just said
so how we're getting along
t uh i wanted to talk about that actually um this speaker um the data processing is fine but uh we don't particularly
want to do the b the the b the gui for it no not really if someo if you wanna do that then
then tell me how you want the data presented how the 'cause do you want me to tell you okay like 'cause at the moment
the the the there is i've created two classes one that represents speakers one that represents the meetings
and the meet and the information about both is contained within each object so and then they wr it writes objects and the objects
contain all the information about the meetings and the speakers so that the who the speakers that are at the meetings and the amount they speak
and then the averages are contained with the speakers so there's two separate class aren't there and
they all they're two different objects and you can recall they can write the it writes the objects and then you call the objects back and they ha those
returned objects have all the information that they need and then you can call methods to return whatever you want
or everything but that's why i wanted to know how ho what's the easiest way to have the data
yeah supposedly all calculated yeah um and all stored as objects so dot object files
um which means that you just ret call constructor and call the load thing and call it there and you can create a list of them
or a vector of them or whatever you wanna do yeah and then or just call them one at a time to populate window but that's what i wanted to
how y how what format do you want the data to come back in 'cause it can come back as a almost anything
what's easiest to display on the screen
yeah
yeah
yeah ca you could
yeah yeah yeah yeah so um
so i can have it so that it returns you a 'cause at the moment the main data structures are
hash tables for the meetings that say it's got one that says percent it's called percent talk
one's percent noise and one is percent participation do you see what i mean so and then it's got inside it's got a link for it's got a
it's got the n speaker's name and then it's got their percentage for that thing so it can either come back as a you
can have the hash table or you can have it returned as a vector and it will say noise uh
just a string is noise w x percent it will say vector this cou i don't know whatever w you can either
have it th you could either have it you could i have it like an embedded in vector or array of strings and each one represents one
person or whatever what the what the easiest thing dec how how you wanna display it
okay
yeah exactly exactly
yeah
see that's the ca how did we can i have a look at that again
okay s if it's in that format it's speaker it's speaker
speaker is the uh controlling thing not yeah yeah okay yeah yeah yeah so
all of this uh all that's calculated as well stored as speaker objects yeah that's that's easy some are
quite amusing actually the uh the influences of i lived in germany for six months don't know if that had any effect just spend too
much time talking to brits that was bizarre thing where did these people come from
so then the all that's calculated as well all i have to do is get the dialogue acts i don't think that'll be difficult
um
so then does this how does is how is this box populated is it populated by the one present or the one highlighted
the one present okay
'cause at the moment i'm using there is there are methods that say um for the using for other talks so
that's and it says like get get talk time and you and y it takes a name so that w could call that
would call that and call the meetings method that said return that and that would populate that which should be an easy thing to do
um and the same for that comes out there
meetings yeah yeah
yep yeah yeah that would be easy as well yeah
yeah okay so i'll w i'll just leave in lots of methods that st that'll just return one number at a time that'll be the easiest way to do yeah okay yeah that's fine
yeah get talk time i think it's called at the moment something like that yeah
no it's stored as an object file it processes a whole lot off line and stores it as an object and then they're much much smaller they're only like
a one um one thou one k yeah it's all pre processed and then it's just each method
object's got a return bunch of return methods you have to g re create the object it's got a load method so what you do is you call a null
constructor 'cause if you call the th proper constructor for each meeting it goes off and does all the processing and stores own object
and then um if you call a null constructor then you pr call load and you can call load and whatever one or all
of them or anything like that go through a list
yeah
one object for each meeting yeah although yeah yeah although you c
yeah it's just tell it tells you who participated at the moment it tells you who participated and the amount they participated in percentages and in time as well
yeah yeah that'll be pro that'd be easy yeah
yeah if that won't be too difficult but that would be that would cause a problem with anything that wasn't annotated for topics
oh yeah no topic specified yeah have a default yeah there are some there are some default actually the um a lot of people don't get their own ch and other stuff but
yeah
okay right y oh yeah that wouldn't be a problem and then you could do a search over the meetings over the objects 'cause that's the thing these these are so small they can load each o all of the whole lot up and do a search of the whole lot to find who by who and what problem or what topics were in what so it doesn't crash the thing
what the global statistics come straight off of that don't they 'cause they're just for the meter met th the
the speaker class knows about all of that stuff and the meeting class knows about that stuff
um
no no but i don't think that'll be too difficult
what we want yeah i thought the other stuff was more important anyway so i did that first
mm no design the gui first and uh 'cause it it w the problem is if you change the classes it the object's serial numbers change and you can't re load the object so all the processing has to be done over again and i haven't quite finished it so
it would become out of synch and get a bit funny if i gave you one if i gave you it one
and you worked on it and then i changed it and run the thing again you wouldn't ever be able to load the objects back up and you'd have
to and then you'd have a v multiple copies of objects all over the place and it'd get silly i think
but if you can if you wanna make the picture c you can do that without anything i'm presuming ju just the that yeah the text box 'cause that doesn't okay
alright well it won't take very long to get it all finished but i think i'll need to have done all of this stuff too first 'cause otherwise the objects won't be the same
no it's on my home directory
yeah no i haven't global yet when it's finished up global otherwise it would get confusing
that way it doesn't crash if you try and load all ten in one it crashes doesn't it it it's a bit dumb if you can fool it
if you c if you c load up ten different si engines simultaneously it can do that fine
but it can't do them it can't do them if it thinks one 'cause then it's about the amount that each if you you have
to kinda call a new class and then it will do it fine but if you don't then it won't l yeah it says okay oh yeah
i've got all this space you can use some otherwise it goes oh no it
talks to me yeah say nice machine it goes
oh they're done are they okay cool
they pop up uh yeah
welcome to the l s n l s d browser some some some speech and some music
some drum rolls yeah yeah yeah
yeah or a switch board that comes up that's just a blank form like that with some buttons on load me a meeting load me a search load me something else whistle a tune
yeah
hmm i that's cheaper than x t search it would need you to have a meeting loaded before it will start doing any searching at all doesn't it
you can't the the only thing you can search is a nite object model and the only time you get one of those if you've loaded an observation
yeah which we but doesn't that way c you cou you could use the inverted file search to return a list of of meetings and then use one of those to load a search but you won't
it has to be an observation and even if you go and se you can go and search the whole corpus from that but you have to have it has to start with something
for some bizarre reason the engine there's only one there's only one search method to the search engine
uh the engine class only has one search method
yeah yeah globally yeah
yeah
yeah
yep
it doesn't take long to load up anyway you can load a dumb one up that doesn't have any
exactly yeah
yeah but only gives one at a time anyway doesn't it 'cause otherwise you'll crash the thing
yeah it's not too slow though that thing it shouldn't it's not it's not too bad on that i don't think that will be a much of a problem
yeah yeah
yeah
yeah yeah ma make it strings for as long as possible and then only return the things when they actually needs to has to search when it needs to be loaded
yeah
yeah
yeah
did we think about um
better names for the meetings
oh do they do they re translate them
do they okay well that's alright then we'll just use that then
well that's what's the that's the working group is it okay i wanna see the meetings about even better understanding

okay that's cool that's good
so who would the the um i d f s i mean the d f s the document frequencies for each word in the corpus
yeah to do um what steve's talking about you do to do the topic labelling
if somebody's done the keywords or the the g i d f s or the d f s already would
can't you do any better for our search without the t f i d f
i think you need to it's the amount that they occur
over documents basically the amount they d f is the document frequency is the amount that each word occurs
um no what is it term frequency is the amount that that it occurs
in ea one of them is the amount it occurs in each document and the other one is the amount it g occurs generally
so if you so the more it occurs in specific documents compared compared to its general score the bet more informative
it is about a certain
the corpus the corpus still data yeah no yeah yeah but plus a stop list so you remove stuff that doesn't ta it like yeah and then the which is gonna a a prob basically equal score
or a massive
bunch of key words that'd probably be easiest thing key words yeah key words three f three five words in both documents yeah term frequency inverse document frequency
i did do it once i do have a java class that does it for something i don't know whether it'll work with this but
yeah
yeah
yeah also key words gives you a a whole new type of search you do keyword search but you could do key word search could be topic search can they can be the same thing instead uh it would just search for key words when it when they you tell him that with topics but actually get searching with key words
for each do you see what i mean
but i suppose even calculating the the w the the what's its faces
themselves would be too much too long the easy bit is it's probably the easiest to calculate them based upon in
their whole occurrences in i in the corpus than it is to calculate them per topic
'cause you don't have to integrate as much information
no you can do you can do search without t f i d f you just can't rank the search
yeah no no no but that's what isn't that what the idea was in the first place to rank these rank the results so that
yeah but that won't slow it down ranking it won't slow it down
yeah it still uses an inverted file but it ranks the results by the amount by the higher yeah i thought that was part of it but yeah okay it doesn't matter if it's not
um
no we did yeah
but yeah i guess uh if you do if if that's not part of it don't worry about it it doesn't
'cause i'm only gonna do this if i've got time anyway so
yeah well it'd just give you a rank it would that was the whole point was to if you say this is your top one this is your bottom
yeah but say but it's how how informative that t f i d f is an informative score isn't it so
depends how you treat your compound nouns
like what
as a compound noun uh sunny day yeah and like an adjective yeah um
in its most simple form it would do a separate rank for each one each term you could make it more complicated and make it do for th for the yeah
yeah you can just add 'em up or you can
yeah yeah yeah you don't wanna start looking for bo
yeah um
i guess you just do a sum of the um of the the individual t f i d f for each
term returned and that generally will be a bit crude but it will give you a d score and the higher the more uh more
informative each term is for each thing would give you a
a thing it's pretty crude anyway but it's just looking for um
if it's all it's gonna do is look for six separate c oh 'cause then it's gonna go into the n x t search and return that isn't it so mm yeah yeah yeah that's true so yeah that's less crude isn't it but um
groups of terms yeah without doing any like um word pairs which is just omission
yeah i don't know how that works that's how i remem
yeah but then the idea is that gives you an informative score how you combine that is is up
to you i guess it there's lots in the literature i if s if you were is there's a lo whole load
about it in manning and schutz so they've got a whole chunk about it's so just i r isn't this basic
information retrieval they've got a big a good chapter on it if you haven't got it it's on cognate yeah yeah
yeah me too hundreds of p d f s
yeah
okay
do you want that on the start up screen yeah 'cause
yeah i guess so yeah yeah i guess that's useful
uh you can have a save preferences you could have a save preferenc preferences i guess
well alright call it favourites then you can have a favourites
yeah it's not enough information is it to

yeah yeah
yeah
yeah it would be quite good if it has yeah
just a b search buttons so just
mm
yeah yeah doofus mode
or search yeah yeah so if even if it just had two things just said one sai one said take me straight to this meeting
and have a m text box you can enter it or a drop down menu and then another that said search that loaded instantly it loaded up the search screen
yeah yeah yeah or one that yeah or one that
yeah
yeah or the other thing to do is just have search as the default just it opens and the search window opens and that's the interface and you just go from there
and then that brings up the browser after you f searched for something or or the search but the search window could have
on it something that said just has a drop down menu that says just and a go button that said take me to this
and so the f so the in yeah so the f only thing that comes up when you're finished is a um when you start
it's just one window like that and it's got all the search stuff like down there and so this is your search
it's just all here and here is just go to wherever and a go button and then from
there it takes you to wherever else you wanna go yeah
and the other topic says welcome to welcome to our browser
a drop drop down menu
oh you wanna have oh yeah the users
they're always nonsense yeah
yeah that's true
yeah it does
this is good but if you wanna search a search if you wanna look for one meeting and just look at it then that's fine um
that's that's true that's or unless you have two one one is one one there where you got two
one for meeting one to speak or and you can choose you can go go for go or go for the other go on go for both if you go for both you're searching
yeah
we could do microsoft stylie and hold it over and it pops up a thing
is that complicated
mouse over isn't it or something actually in this n oh let's do that then
you get out of the bloody way i'm trying to do a search the damn thing
yeah that's true that's annoying but that's why you could just have a list of your users then
and just you just say i wanna look for this user go find me find me then then then it pulls up a list of all
the ones who got that user in it and then you search then but then you didn't search maybe just leave it just have them
there and don't worry about the speakers if they're doing speakers they're doing search it's not the same as doing a
a quick access
yeah or you can have a f text box there that's got yeah as you go over them then that doesn't get in your in the way
yeah the full name and then speakers
yeah we can do all of that without even ever going anywhere near loading up a
i think
oh cool and uh a thing a meeting a nom yeah
i think it's in the right object model but i'm not sure
no uh yeah is you're right it's the right corpus yeah it's the not right corpus and then you got not right elements in it got not right attributes in
yeah i think the n ones are interfaces and the nite one one of the ways round one's an interface and one's actually an implemented
class uh 'cause you go back enough and the um the what's its name is not very good the a p i is alright
but there's not a lot of description in it it's very crude it tells you what
yeah yeah yeah
so you end up just it saying returns an n text box okay what's that doh it's a implementation
of an n text interface what's that oh it's a extended version of
a stop it
might be useful mightn't it
yeah i should have more to talk about
oh for next week
no just after s p two
yeah yeah i don't mean straight after
yeah for that yeah that could be quite good
right um
friday morning
three o'clock
i don't know maybe i do i'm not sure what i'm doing this weekend um
two should we say three o'clock and then if there's a v serious problem i'll tell you
it's might not be too we th i don't think we need a probably
three's better than five or six
three so say three o'clock and then um if there's a problem with that then if three o'clock's a problem five or six will be a problem 'cause i won't be here but i don't think that won't be i'm not sure
is she collecting them oh you're just sending it to no i mean is she
collecting oh right oh yeah sorry yeah school for the gifted
yeah well i thought somebody was collecting them but right well that's what i thought when you said that
then we'd know who's missed them or who's if we've done any
yeah
yeah
no
yeah that would help a lot for that s for single terms it would be very useful for multiple terms unless you wanna do something there will be a way of doing it for multiple terms
yeah or you could do it and override it by the you ca you could just ignore the d ranking if it doesn't show up together or you could perhap you could penalize it you could just put a b weight against it
yeah you do the n x t so so it doesn't show up together either disregard it or put a weighting against it so if you g how many pairs you get you can
yeah so then just next yeah
yeah might have to talk to pernilla about that
'cause some things you're gonna get a lot of results for and if the one that you got just happened to be at the bottom when it was actually the most relevant one something like that would just push it up
yeah which is the highest exactly and um also with their something like sunny
day the um if sunny and day aren't mentioned together a lot but
sunny just happens to mentions once then its term will be low and it will push down the other one if you combine them if you just dup add them together
yeah yeah but you have no ranking system at the moment so if something's an amazing w highly ranked thing from t f i d f
it could just be ignored because it falls off the bottom of the do you have a assuming you only have you have a return all results
for all so you type language and it returns seventy five meetings
yeah there are already seventy f but there are seventy five meeting yeah yeah
so if it m so yeah if you return seventy five wh where do you stop how do you rank them or something or returns twenty even if it returns twenty do you cut off at ten do you rank them do you what's the threshold something like that would be
look through them all yeah one at a time and
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah
so is that it
we're done tick i've signed off already
'kay

hmm did you wanna take a look at comments there's more uh
yeah
oh okay
excellent
okay right see ya
okay
yeah
mm
'kay
um one thing that i was wondering is there a standard control that you
use to connect the different things like if you're in a topic and it goes and highlights the topic in the text or whatever
is there a particular type of control that like is there one of these n x t or sorry um nite controls
n o m or
okay
mm you haven't had to build any new windows to do that sort of thing like other topics or
well we're gonna do one for speaker i guess and all the rest right or no no well okay um when we talk about
speaker characterization how are we accessing the list of speakers
okay
right
hmm
okay
okay
okay
yeah
actually i know that might also help like when he was talking about like have an architecture that things are gonna plug into i mean so that things
are all modular i mean it would be a good idea if we used that same idea for anything else we do or what else are we doing um
actually even the searches or whatever you know just any sort of thing i mean search results if they're all in a predictable thing with a name certain
properties or a list of properties a vector whatever um
mm right
h um yeah yeah just a matter of deciding what we what would be easiest all the way around i mean
oh right okay strange

right

hmm
hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
so each time are you going straight to the x m l files for for the information or right oh well oh i see okay i see okay right
right okay so it's all just pre processed and just okay thanks right okay right okay that's cool
yeah right
right is this is it for the entire corpus or is it just like individual ones like t one fi one object for okay that's nice oh each meeting okay alright
wonder if that would be useful for some of the other stuff we're doing well yeah no no no just
right okay
okay
yeah
alright
or just return a null or a blank or a blank string or something yeah yeah
hmm
alright
yeah right okay it's a good idea

mm hmm

yeah

yeah
yeah
'kay
mm hmm
yeah
yeah actually i can up load my stuff as well i just have to make one change to your file just to load this one instead of the the default so it's two lines of code so
um what do you mean
well yeah just the one thing that's like the action for loading up the search thing
yeah well your version yeah yeah yes no i did in my directory just uh just do that yeah
um i have a copy yes i'm yeah but i will yeah i was going to update that one just 'cause yeah it just makes sense that then you then you can test out yeah right
right yeah and then update yep
yeah yeah i haven't i haven't made any changes to it yet so yeah um yeah i'll just make that one and i'll let you know
'cause yeah like i say two lines of code if that so anyways um and then you can play there's not much to do yet but have to get better results like better presented
yeah yeah and just um to wire in the the topics and uh summaries
so um yeah that's pr well also yeah like that that as well so yeah
yeah just wanna find out what kind of objects those were that um for the other ones
so it goes in and highlights 'cause that's i know
hmm
oh yeah
okay
right
okay
okay sounds good
um so yeah just a few more things to do with that and then uh once pernilla gets the uh the index
um then that's gonna be kind of fun like i'm just wondering have you had to well the way you're doi i was gonna ask if the way you were doing
it you were loading like a new corpus each time for each meeting but you're doing the objects so you don't need to
just uh 'cause if we're if we do have t like if the inverted search says that there's you know ten documents are we gonna have to load
each of these ten corp corpora just to um do the individual next uh n x t search
yeah i think probably yeah
are you serious that's a
yeah okay that's insane 'kay
right okay okay


oh yeah okay
okay oh
okay
hmm
or just or is it more like right
oh right yeah exactly it doesn't take too long no just we have to yeah while we're debugging
we'll probably be getting sick of it um but no or something that just sort of guides them to the most obvious things
yeah
hmm right
yeah
yeah
yeah right
mm should mm
yeah i was just gonna ask if we should assume that they all wanna load a meeting first but not necessarily i guess if they're doing a search on the entire yeah corpus
yeah that kinda makes sense
right well we can put the logic in a yeah
i could probably even that s shouldn't be too hard to put a check in there and if it hasn't loaded then force him to load one
mm hmm
mm hmm
yeah mm hmm
unless they know what meeting it is well yeah it's hard to
yeah
yeah or well the things they may n just be looking for a word or whate you know like and if it shows up ten different meetings then at that point they'll probably wanna like we do we want to like if it dumped by default goes with the first one and they want number five of the ones that are returned i mean then they have to go through the
well no t like to load up like the thing is that i think
uh like when it loads up it'll load up the transcript window and the whatever other window right now i think just the topic ones
um although the time is probably more um caused by loading the actual data
so i'm just thinking if it's kinda like you were saying you have to have a nom object right
i mean before you do a search at all on this yeah okay right yeah that's true yeah
yeah but the okay the global one feeds into the local um so if we're getting any usable data it's it's gonna be doing a search on each of those files so it's gonna be loading up each of those one at a time to get the data that we wanna
right but it's it could be time consuming like if there are ten documents that hit with this thing then
oh
um yeah well i'm j just thinking of some way we could you know st cash the results and in a nice little format that'll
make things a bit easier but the thing is i mean if we've got that then it's gonna be needing really really to load
the entire corpus for that meeting if uh if it's trying to show us where those were if it's trying to highlight
those in the text transcript or whatever and we're gonna have to have all that other data in there so each time when we have a she search window
and we have like you know ten different meetings you know with the word wireless comes up go to meeting one then it has to reload
the nom object next one imitating machine process i mean that's gonna that
could be yeah okay right
it always seems to be slow loading up the first time at least like that's all i i've been doing lately is just sort of loading it up test it
try something else and then shut down load it up but so um so just sorta based
on that as a yeah but uh if it doesn't take that long each time then that should be f
alright
hmm
yeah yeah right
yeah
yeah that's true
yeah that
yeah
yeah that makes sense and that way if they know specifically which meaning it is then that'll save the time because i'm sure they don't wanna have the extra loading time either if they could avoid it so yeah or they could check mark against the ones they wanna check so
well i think they were in the text we can probably do that ourselves and just sort of b d b you know just do a a string
yeah the long names yeah yeah like the the working group that it's part of yeah that probably even might have a
yeah
yeah right

see if it's accurate
um do we actually need the uh the frequencies
yeah
oh right that right yeah okay yeah
well thing is if it's being done there were there was
yeah there's a 's trying to get uh to work on friday um they did
have all that and it was sorta built in and just uh had some trouble getting it running properly um but it had sort of all
that standard sort of stuff but it w it last i heard it wasn't working so she was gonna look at you know more straight forward
sorta thing that really just fulfils what we need it to do but if we need the if we do need the frequencies then
um i don't know
um well it was would've been like a list of
what's it stand for
hmm
mm
well the corpus yeah so yeah the probably probably term frequency yeah so the general one is pr yeah yeah
right
actually what's the i in t f i d f really okay
oh yeah
alright
yeah
uh huh
right
oh yeah well do we need to i mean we're just looking oh for for your s for your stuff i guess yeah for topic with
um
yeah
yeah
hmm i don't think we had that in the the document yeah yeah exactly i know
hmm
right yeah b nice to have mm hmm right
mm well i don't know actually 'cause the thing is i mean typically yeah but th um
the thing is we're just looking for when it happens in a meeting if they're looking for particular term or something they just wanna know if that term exists there
and where does it exist and i wanna see it you know
yeah
'kay
but if it's like a two word term does the t f i d f handle that
it's not a compound noun it's just two words together um in f i don't
know i don't know just something like uh edinburgh university yeah
well essentially i don't know or sunny day you know
hmm
let's not make it more complicated yeah because the thing is the thing is that
the way we were doing it we were just looking for the words period each word in the um in the index well that's way we were thinking about
it and then then it's just saying were these two words in in any of these documents and then if it was then we go closer and do the the n x t search
uh to look for the exact term or the regular expression or whatever
yeah
right
yeah or we choose the list of meetings that we wanted to search to do that so yeah
um
like i'm just wondering if if it's gonna give us something cool then yeah absolutely but if it's sort like if the n x t search has still gotta be run to find these terms or these you know these patterns then uh
or also like do um wild cards work for something like that so if you're looking for wireless wired wire blah blah blah you do wire with a star and um no not y actually that's a problem for me too so or pernilla and uh
yeah 'cause
actually it should work yeah okay then i'm just yeah sure that's not too bad
oh yeah
oh yeah okay
yeah i've got uh somewhere p d f
yeah what if it's yeah do the p d f s switch it to postscript switch it back to p d f and then
don't know okay so that's okay that might be good
alright okay
oh i thought we sort of dis you know what i mean
mm hmm yeah
yeah or attended yeah
p probably for the most part i mean there'll be a set of people that do and then a sub set for each meeting probably
search for stuff or start working or no or or browse okay like search browse um
like if you're looking for something speci like is that what you're thinking like if they if they know exactly where they wanna go they wanna go to you know that meeting on december third and they just wanna go there and see stuff then they can immediately go and browse that um
yeah
right
yeah
yeah browse by meeting browse by blah browse by speaker like did no i'm just thinking of different
ways we can do that like different buttons on the top like if they're looking for particular person particular working group particular whatever
i mean we just uh we could break things down like that to that level of detail if we want or
we could keep a more general yeah
um yeah but i'm just thinking like initially when they load up what are the range of things that they'd wanna do like if they're part of x working group they'll wanna get in there um do we wanna save preferences
well if they're part of b d b working group they're gonna wanna look at the b d b ones and so we'd default to that or don't know
based on what they did the last time yeah
mm hmm
mm yeah okay right yeah yeah okay yeah that's yeah right
what was that yeah exactly i forget right um
okay well no i'm just getting back to sorta what could be on the the start up screen like there is just a range
of things we could do we could have like search options browse options i mean just i don't know just playing around with
ideas um and then we can tie this into
our evaluation uh tasks and say well if you want to search for a meeting or search for a user in a particular
meeting then do this blah blah blah so we can yeah sort of um you know guide them and just like hey my task
is to do this and there's a button for it oh p perfect you know you know i don't know
no no that's not what i'm suggesting no i'm just saying like these are just like a lot of programmes well kind of
lame programmes do have that sort of thing first just 'cause they don't want people to have to go through all the menus and search themselves and just like
do commonly used tasks or just exit and just let me use the programme you know as well
so
probably or search something yeah
yeah like find specific meeting you know that's an easy sort of thing and mm
mm hmm fits his criteria
well we don't actually have user names do we aren't there all these codes like ami eleven or whatever yeah
yeah
in a case like that we do want drop down we don't want them to type them do we
okay um and allow multiple no okay you're just looking for one specific speaker right yeah
okay
alright
oh for speakers m
oh mm hmm
a tool tip mm hmm


yeah
'cause
yeah that's true yeah
yeah
yeah just so yeah that's like nice and easy yeah
mm hmm right
just yeah just but it's i think in that case it's the wr write corpus is that what it is writable corpus or something yeah
yeah yeah
yeah and n x t something and
oh right
yeah

yeah right yeah
yeah
area yeah

yeah drove you crazy oh god
hmm
um not really just gonna keep on going

like friday afternoon or something
okay then we won't have to have the meeting with steve on tuesday or at all yeah so do we wanna arrange this get this one earlier maybe three or i don't know
yeah that's true
true
mm 'kay yeah sure
um
hmm possibly i don't know usually by then it's need a break um although well i don't know 'cause it's the lab and try and get some work done for the the lab stuff
yeah
oh okay ten to two
or th three o'clock or no or you wanna get out get away okay right
'cause i think she's got a class at eleven we've all got cla well three of us have class at twelve um could go
or if we could try one we could try shortly after well yea yeah well yeah well it wouldn't be a long meeting then or no would you wanna no probably not if one's bad for you then it won't okay
right okay
yeah yeah
okay

yeah

yeah
right
um there's just sorta the basic implementation stuff that i was wondering about but um no it should be fine
um it's just progressing um we d did we decide whether it should be ranked no
for now 'cause

yeah well i d i kinda think it would complicate things quite a bit and not bring us
a lot just because if it is like independently doing the words for a particular document it's not
it's not really getting them together like if someone's looking for a particular term um i don't know it just
i just don't know if it would bring us that much
how so
if if if they're looking for like i say sunny day and you know sunny shows up in this document
day shows up but they're not together um or if if they are toge i don't know it just doesn't you're looking
for that term and relevance is kind of irrelevant because if the term shows up it shows up
hmm
right
in in that sense for single for single word yeah yeah
yeah well create a new yeah yeah
yeah
well but you still have to do the search you still have to do the n x t search then right if if it doesn't show up
yeah yeah i know yeah oh yeah yeah it'll yeah yeah well it wouldn't show up on the search
results if it if it didn't exist together so
yeah
yeah okay we'll have we'll have to talk to pernilla about this then just 'cause uh see how she's uh doing this 'cause if we are using that i mean it does make sense for that but uh yeah and just actually yeah yeah
yeah well that's sorta what is yeah that's true
well the thing is also i mean if it's well yeah yeah okay i see what you mean um
and then we could actually put that like on the list of um meetings that r get returned if there were fifteen meetings with language is in then it's
gonna show you those and rank them as to which is the highest so okay i see that
hmm
yeah well the thing is i mean that'll be exactly how we're doing it now like we're just looking for the two words separately see if they exist in the same document if they do then there's a possibility that they c occur together and then we do the n x t search on that document
yeah no
hmm
um well right now it's not doing anything so i don i don't know i don't know what what it's doing but yeah well i thou yeah yeah i think so yeah
yeah
yeah yeah yeah that's true okay
hmm look through them all well
yeah
i think so
okay
yeah

mm
well hi everyone again
um like before we uh i have to redo the meetings from n th the minutes from the last meeting and so here we go
uh it was discussed in the last meeting uh which was opened by the presentation from the interface um
designer that uh looks would be very important
on this new remote and um it is to send messages of course
to the t v it should have nine channel buttons a next button volume buttons subtitle
buttons switch to control features colour contrast sharpness etcetera
it should have a memory switch a mute button in case the telephone rings or something uh speech recognition is
one of her very f favourite personal uh features she would like see d d to be integrated
in this um in this new remote um
should be child friendly design with few buttons colourful maybe with s star shaped
or other shaped buttons um she uh presented also an
oversized remote which she guarantees nobody will ever be able to lose
um
that's right
but uh her very f personal favourite really she she would very much like to see a speech
recogniser integrated in this remote the industrial designer um presented
her uh thoughts on the issue she would like
a special case made out of plastic that is very strong not using any harmful materials
should be recyclable and should be colourful
should have an integrated circuit board that's highly sophisticated and temperature resistant
she would like to see a timer and or alarm facility integrated
uh technically this thing would also have a resistor and a capacitor diode
transistor resonator and if possible a rechargeable battery
uh and of course a circuit board
and how it would works you press the button the chip is morse morse code related
relays the uh to the generat to the generator amplification
and uh the circuit board is very inexpensive to build
and so she thinks this is a great feature uh to to to consider
she would like uh this whole thing should be push buttons with a simple chip
uh scrolling method is more expensive and not that practical anymore
should be battery operated and of course she would have the special cases
the marketing expert uh who has to finally come up
with to to to market this product has been watching the competition has done some research on
the internet and also has used h her personal observations to come up
with the fact that such a remote sh should be small
easy to use and it should be eye catching
from her point of view of course one of the most important facts is that we should get to market before our competition does
to do that uh maybe one or two features should be developed on which we could dwell on or in other words on which our campaign could be built on
too many new features or too many points would only confuse matter so we prefer to have one or two features that can be really uh driven home
um it should have a fruit and vegetable design and should have a soft feel she feels that's really what people want today
and the decision that we took last time was that uh the special feature we would like to see is a speech recogniser
the energy should be battery uh should be on a chip should be trendy design compact and strong and should have buttons
and that concludes the presentation from the last minutes from the last meeting
now uh we are ready for the presentation of the prototype
mm hmm

mm hmm mm hmm
mm hmm mm hmm
what kind of button
menu uh menu th menu uh one one
okay
mm hmm
mm hmm
yes the buttons are all raised right
are raised mm hmm
right
or have two hands to operate it yeah
yes and it sort of sticks up so that you really you don't have to g first go like oh yeah here it's on and yeah mm hmm
so if you're left handed or right handed it doesn't matter
well i have one question uh will there be anything written on the buttons like that people know or they have to learn that from a piece of paper which button does what
will have symbols so that that that the user really knows you know and doesn't have to first learn it
yeah but anyway it would ha i i i it has to have some kind of of symbols text or something so that people kn
that's right
okay yeah just wanted make sure of that mm hmm
right mm hmm
mm hmm
right
now what what are our special features for the marketing that's really the voice recognition that's really unusual
and then and then the other thing would basically be sh shape or practicality of use
you know
colours
mm hmm
cutest
yeah
okay now uh having said that
no now this was our evaluation criteria which we uh just have done now we're gonna talk about financing

well there is a production evaluation is that you
but that's after the financing see fi see

um
okay we had looks and voice recognition okay now on the financing we
bring up the mm there it is okay
uh energy source we say that's battery right
okay now
so we i guess we use one
what
t cell or chart you are trying to change is protected well that's nice
she told me i could just ch change it here and then it would
it doesn't work
hmm
oh okay yeah okay let's see okay one okay oh
go away um kinetic source so that's in the energy source that's all we need uh
electronics simple chip on print is that's what we're using one of those
come on okay one uh regular chip on print no
that's all we need the one case uncurved flat single curved double curved
double curved one of those
case materi s supplements plastic we said right
uh wood rubber
uh but yes but
that's just for the case material so special colours though we having that right
and then we have to interface push buttons
scroll wheel no integrated scroll wheel l c display
button
no
uh button supplement special colour
special form
and special material rubber wood yes
okay
total seven point six whatever that means
that's the price
mm
eight eight point two
that's hmm
eight point two right
so we looks like we are
well within budget
okay
i guess i should save this i suppose huh
oops
uh huh huh huh
i just tried that my documents computer my compu ah oh here it is yes
okay fine save
okay good so that's the good news we gonna be popular um
so that uh i think financing was pretty simple
now we would like to have a presentation by the marketing expert on production evaluation
you wanna go to the next slide okay
um i just realised one thing in the financing there was no room for our voice recogniser
and uh i don't know how we can evaluate that or how we can include that too
eight eight twenty yes
i mean maximum we have another four point three euros i mean four thirty
but i mean we have no way of presenting that to management as you know as a f finished as a finished product and saying okay with the voice recogniser that costs so much
so um we just have to beware of that i mean and know whether the four thirty will really cover that

yeah
i'm sorry to interrupt then but i just uh recog i just remembered that there was no that that
was not um included uh that there was no room for any special features
okay so to beware of that you wanna go to this next slide marketing expert
i dunno yes it is mm hmm
oh
why wh why you need that up
i think you can make it there
yes i think uh shape is one
you you gave it a four
um i dunno
i think i would give it at least a two
colour uh i
one
i i like the colours one
uh i think i would give it a two
well it's also you can't really try it out uh the other things you have have more is are more tangible so from that point of view but um
i'll give it a three
uh
here is what we looking at uh satisfaction on for example room for creativity
um
is there more room for creativity or are we absolutely happy
y um al always bearing in mind that right now we are of course well within the budget and that we still you
know we probably can't with this particular item we probably can't just uh
add a whole lot of more things uh um we need uh
you know we need to leave space money wise for the voice recogniser
um
so th the question really is how do we feel with the project process uh um
are we happy with the creativity that has passed here or we're not happy
with the new product we created or that was created
uh i think personally i think uh i'm pretty happy
um an
and then the next question is are we happy with the leadership of this project uh
and i think team work i think was very very good i think we really yeah
mm hmm
and uh i think we are we happy with the means we used we used whiteboard we didn't use digital p well digital pens i guess are these things
yes we could uh it's maybe not in the best position in the room um
you know like sometimes it's positioned so that it's much better visible for everybody and i think from that point
of view we sort of ignored it a little bit
yes i think so i think absolutely and fortunately we all had slides presentation which made it a little easier um did we new did we find new ideas i think we did
i think we we did uh in more than one respect and uh so i think we did very well here
are the costs within budget yes yes uh is the project evaluated yes um then celebration

so i i thank you all very much um i think this was very good and um
i think we did come up with a new product that's uh feasible feasible from the production point of view and feasible from a marketing point of view
so thank you
i always get it on here but getting it off is
ah yes we have time later but we don't
hello
designer

yes
yeah just the look like the button part i'll explain

okay now the um we decided upon including certain features on our remote
now these features includes the s um signal emitting uh signal it's
the led or l e d the infrared now uh we have included the
switch on and off button
now we have included another feature that is the mute button
on the side of the model then we have included one to nine buttons
for controlling the programmes the different channels
we have also included two buttons for increasing or decreasing the volume
and we have also included two buttons for scrolling up and scrolling down the programme channels
now our our model also contains a button which is called as the menu button
menu button
yes menu
at the centre
we have included a button which is fluorescent green colour and this is the menu button which will control the colour sharpness brightness
of this uh picture
we have also included a button which is called as the swapping button
now this is uh a special special feature which we have included now this button
is an elongated shaped button and this is slightly flexible so if it is turned towards the right it will take to the previous channel if it is turned towards the right it will take to the next channel
it will take the user to the previous and the next channel so this is a
swapping button
no swapping is if if example you're you're watching the second channel and then you go to the tenth channel and if you want to go back to the second channel you can swap this button yes
and at the end it this remote has inbuilt voice recogniser which c which will recognise the user's voice and then it'll act accordingly
so this is our proposed model now the marketing expert has to
give her suggestion whether it'll be sellable or it'll be cost effective
yes yes
yes
mm

abs okay
no these the front buttons which are here are the mute buttons yes yes
yes

pardon me
this is the menu yes yes
a the the these these two are th to increase or decrease the volumes and these two are to uh scroll the programme channels
scroll up or scroll down the channels

yes it will have uh these buttons will have the numbers and all the rest of the buttons will have symbols yes which can be easily recognised
yes
yes
yes
yes
yes
yes
and
and one more feature is we we have a holder for this remote which is an oyster shape a shell shape
yes yes
yes snail shell
yes
mm hmm
y yes

yes
yes
yes
single curve mm
plastic
is this for the case yes
yes
yes
no
speci

yes
yes yes you've done a good job
whiteboard more yes yes
yes
no
yes

cel celebration yes yes

thank you
okay
they say it's forty minutes
okay
hello

yeah
yeah
uh so this is our what uh we have made this is a model of the remote control which we
are going to build uh this is us in a snail shape so uh
it it is attractive um and it's it's blue in colour uh bright and
uh it has yellow buttons and all the different colour buttons so it is a uh uh a looks wise it is
beautiful uh and also compact in shape uh um and also i it
it will be easily fit into into the hands and you can access all the buttons easily
yeah oops sorry
um yeah and um uh the material which we are going to use for the case is uh plastic and uh w which which is s strong um uh and also uh for the
um the material is plastic and uh for the buttons it is uh s soft rubber
um and als yeah yeah because uh uh you'll be touching the buttons more
so it is soft when you touch it
and then um uh for the for the led for the light emitting diode it is a fluorescent green and it's a a it is a bulb like an ordinary infrared
and and the button button's part uh will be explained by f francina
tell yeah

mm hmm
mm hmm

hmm
mm hmm

ah
yeah definitely
yeah yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah of course and also
hmm
yeah
yeah we can
text
text that we can have on the case itself we can it will be printed on the case and symbols as well as the buttons yeah
yeah
so it is yeah yeah shell
mm hmm
mm
yeah of course yeah
mm mm hmm
mm
mm
mm hmm

mm
yeah
yeah
mm hmm
yeah yeah
no
yeah
this is a
yeah
yeah
i think uh that is uh f for rubbers that is uh yeah case material
mm hmm
yeah
yeah
uh i think that's the price
maybe it is it just n
yeah
ami
ami should for
yeah
mm hmm
yeah
mm hmm
mm
mm hmm
mm hmm

yeah
yeah
mm hmm
yeah
yeah
eight twenty so
we have um four euros yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah yeah
yeah still
yeah

included yeah
hmm hmm

yeah even my yeah shape is one
yeah even i think it is one it's quite small
yeah one
uh maybe two yeah
uh three mm hmm
yeah
maybe we can
yeah include some more buttons and uh um yeah features we can make the buttons few buttons
smaller uh i think they are quite big so i think i i mean we can just have
small buttons and more buttons in that case if we want to have more features than that
yeah
yeah definitely
mm hmm
yeah definitely yeah two mu mute buttons
hmm
mm hmm
yeah
mm hmm
even i'm happy
yeah
yeah yeah definitely
mm hmm
yeah
yeah
yeah probably
yeah
hmm
yeah many
yeah
ah

yeah
yeah
thank you very much
do we do we have some time left
uh you have
oh alright
hello
mm hmm

and she was challenged on that point
okay
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm good
you used to have all the buttons
oh that's good no that's nice and friendly
mm hmm mm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
okay
yeah okay mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm
menu button
mm hmm
mm hmm of the screen mm mm hmm
the next channel in the numeric pattern or
yeah mm hmm
mm
okay okay
okay
mm hmm

okay well um
what what i really like a lot about it is that you can reach the whole thing with one thumb that you can really hold it in one h you don't need two hands and it's easily reachable even for somebody with a small hand yeah
the buttons are all raised and if you hold it in the centre of your hand you can even reach it over here so you don't
have to turn it around turn it upside down move it up up and down i really like that you really did a
good job on that my little designers um and
um i like the idea that the on off button is in a really prominent place that's that's a really
good good thing
yeah that's great
mm hmm
the colour's very attractive um the um these buttons uh around here are the mute
and these mm hmm
on both sides they're mute so you can push either one okay
and this brings the menu up on the screen this brings the menu up on the screen and the orange ones are
okay
f f okay right very good
uh it looks mm looks like something i can sell
okay and now i'm supposed to yeah
yeah
good point because we need the symbols 'cause we're going into an international market we can't have anything that's language dependent
symbols on it mm hmm mm hmm
mm hmm
mm 'kay mm
mm hmm
for the snail yeah mm hmm we have the snail shell he goes right back into his shell well you know i think we could do something
really funny with this too because the snail is known to be slow and we could have some
sort of little comic effect on our marketing about how this is a rapid snail
or something like that you know that would that would really work so
i think voice recognition is our big selling point 'cause nobody else seems to have that in in this price range
yep uh well i think that everybody's gonna say their remote control is practical i think we have to we have to dwell on on on the appearance we're really gonna have the be the
cutest remote control on the block so i think we have to play with the image play with the snail image um play with the visual and then the voice recognition i think those are the two things to push the look
and the voice recognition they're gonna be our two selling points
i'm supposed to make a little presentation aren't i
okay
ah but in my instructions i think it said i was supposed to go to the board and do something no
yeah that's me
oh okay sorry sorry mm mm
that's right
can you just fill it in in the yellow boxes or
well
i guess it's double curved
mm hmm
rubber because we're gonna have the soft buttons
oh okay the mm hmm mm' kay
mm hmm
mm hmm
no 'cause we didn't put the clock in it after all right
mm hmm
yes
mm hmm
yeah
mm hmm
mm hmm
okay i'll take my file down so you can bring it up
'kay should be able to get it now
'kay why don't you move just to the next slide right away
yeah right away okay well uh obviously my method for uh s
m the marketing of this thing is first to ask the big question will it sell and i think we should show this prototype
to people from various age and socio economic groups and see about any fine tuning that
maybe little things we haven't thought of we can't accept every suggestion of course but maybe we just need to get a few
and show the the prototype to consumer research groups we don't s want somebody to suddenly come to us and tell us
that this button is toxic and you know some child will swallow it and then we won't sell any so we have to get some
input from those people and then after that we just have to go with our best intuition and you know we like it we
think it's good we're gonna get behind it and sell it um next slide please
okay now the things that i was thinking and th my wish list has really been realised
in this prototype i wanted the shape to be biomorphic i didn't want anything with angles and all square i wanted it to be comfy
and roundy so we we've got that the size is small the colour's bright and warm which is what we wanted
we wanted the feel to be as soft as possible we'll have the soft buttons and the way this is shaped even
though it's gonna be hard plastic it feels good in your hand so that's nice and functionality i put last on my list
because people aren't going to use it before they buy it so paradoxically the other features
in other words the look the feel um and the shape that's what people are gonna get in the store
they don't have a television in the store they can't play with it
um so they'll be our main selling points so um th those have been fulfilled
by your prototype and go ahead to the next slide please okay so um
the shape um i think is a a one that's really really excellent shape
the size is small um and th these points are in the importance
for the for the marketing these aren't i in how i feel i think that it's i think that it's
plenty small enough to sell but i think we're sort of right the scale is one to seven i think we're sort of right in the middle
as far as c other competitors
and our colour i think is great the colours are bright and warm and we really do great job there and
given um the constraints that we had i think we got it as soft as possible and then functionality
um i think you did a really good job on functionality obviously we could have ad added different functions but
then we'd disturb something else so i would say that we got to a five out of seven on on functionality
so i think that basically we've got a great product and we can get off and running with it
yes
ah
well um we had what eight eight euros twenty as our cost
and so we've got we've still got four euros to go to spend
mm hmm
well um that's
mm hmm

well as we know in today's technic technological world you can do just about anything at any price the
the the problem is quality so we're just gonna have to settle for whatever quality that will buy us and
um it may not be the greatest quality but it may sell anyway
as we've seen with so many of these kinds of products
uh well i isn't this my last slide maybe go ahead i think that was my last slide yeah um
mm okay
and i'm supposed to present this scale on the whiteboard um and we're supposed to talk about those things as a team now so if you put my last slide back up there
i'm sorry i've um forgot to do that um
hmm well because i can't remember what i put on there
okay now i'm supposed to see how long my leash is here
mm 'kay
you ready so now we're all supposed to say what we think um okay so on shape
i gave it a one
wait what would you ra uh one being good and seven being the worst um what do you think the shape is one okay and be betsy
okay uh huh one okay and how about on size
on size
i gave it a four yeah i feel it's just average
okay
mm hmm
okay okay you're the designer of course you wanna give it a one um and then how about how we doing on colour
colour i gave it a one i really like all those nice bright warm colours
one
one one one okay and how about the feel
taking into um consideration texture and comfort in the hand
okay i gave it a three two yeah three
two okay
and the next is functionality where i i admit i was a little hard on our team here but
yeah
mm hmm
okay
two okay
three
okay
well um
it looks like we've got got ourselves a pretty good product um the functionality's the only place where
maybe we have to think about m m maybe heaven forbid having
another meeting but um
otherwise i think we're we're ready to go to go with this product
anybody else have any other comments or any other things that we feel we should evaluate
mm hmm
well then again if we're gonna um do the speech recognition thing we're gon there gonna
be some buttons that are gonna have to be added for that for the recording of the the speech so that
that's where we're gonna have to do maybe we can eliminate one of the mute buttons instead of having two
mute buttons and um then maybe we can do something
with the um
the volume control maybe we can put that all on one button
um and a couple of other th maybe comp uh consolidate some of the usage an and see what we can do with that
mm hmm
no
mm hmm
mm hmm
i'm pretty happy with it too yeah um it's something i think i can market yeah
i think you've done a good job miss leader
yeah i d i do too i think we worked well together as a team yeah mm hmm
yeah maybe we could've used the whiteboard a little bit more yeah we didn't use that enough
mm hmm
and we used the slide because it was better positioned
mm i think that's true mm hmm
mm hmm
i think we were we were very good yeah mm
mm hmm
okay
yes yes
celebration today we have apple juice and after we sell m million of 'em we have champagne
mm hmm
mm hmm
mm hmm
okay
okay watch i i have my cord behind you here okay
but we we were told we could end the final meeting at any time whenever we felt we were finished
it'll take me the rest of the time to get my microphone out from my necklace

oh there we go
so
hello
no problem
okay that's possible on uh this time of day
starts at three o'clock uh uh let me see
our fourth and last meeting
there he is
yes
okay this our last meeting in this meeting we will discuss our final design
and we will do some evaluation about the not only the product but
also the project and then we're going to close the project today as well
so after this you will be uh free to go and uh spend all your money
and this uh design detailed design meeting uh we will discuss uh
the look and feel of the design the usability interface design and we
will do the product evaluation um in order to do that we
have this agenda
we'll have the prototype presentation first then we will set up some evaluation cri um criteria
then we will look at the finance uh we will have to see if everything we
wanna do is also possible within our budget because everything costs money and the more functions
you wanna have the more money it will cost so we have to see if it fits within the twelve and a half euro
per remote
but we will see that later then we will do the project uh evaluation and the closing after that
we've got forty minutes so we will be finished at half past three
but first um
we will do the this is prototype presentation so if some yeah if somebody wants step forward
okay
okay uh but um i thought in a few meetings earlier
we uh uh tried to keep it uh simple uh just a few buttons
and large buttons but uh i think these are altogether quite a
quite a few buttons
so i'm wondering if we if we neely really need all of those buttons
that's right
yeah
yeah
mm
long time yeah if you put
yeah okay
yeah uh teletext and subtitles are yeah necessary okay
yep
okay so we had somebody about th interfa something about the design of the buttons there
just n normal plain buttons
yeah 'kay
no
no
yeah okay
yep
okay that's nice then because we only have thirty minutes left
i will move on to the finance part which is pretty exciting to see if it's all
possible what we wanna do and i can tell you
that we're going to have a pretty hard time producing this for twelve and a half euros
if we see i don't know if i've filled in correctly so just correct me if you see uh something wrong i counted two batteries but maybe we can also use one i don't know if it's possible
it's rechargeable that's right
okay that's two euros off we need the advanced chip so there's not much to uh
to save there here we have the single curves uh we can see that the difference between uncurved and the single curved is one euro um
i don't know but i think the single curved is good for design and also for the display to have a prominent place on the remote control i think we have to keep that
then we have the case material supplements it's plastic it's the cheapest one we need so that's uh not much to save either but then the biggest costs are the buttons
so maybe we really should try to discard some buttons to uh
keep our costs low because you have to we will have to get the twelve and a half
euros at the end um
so if we let's fir first count the buttons we have now because i sixteen nah that will be even more then eighteen euros
so
seventeen
okay including the help yeah uh seventeen i think we can uh discard the help and the mute button
uh by pressing down volume long or pressing down a a number
long that saves us uh one euro already 'cause then we have got fifteen i think
fifteen buttons
and this is
no those are one i think
yeah but th it's not stated in this files so maybe we can we can even make one button with the volume and the channel in one by pressing
that's possibility as well
so and it's good for the design as well so you can make
uh let's see if you make this
looks a bit like uh
a cross
plus min
uh s yeah channel yeah w
yeah th i think they count uh the materials
yeah on the chip there yeah
that's right that's right
but i think because we have the advanced chip we can just count this as one button but no but i think

yeah maybe it is but then it seems to me that it's impossible to
get the twelve and a half euros also the l c display
i think it's i think it's too expensive for the display we use i think they
uh try t
that's right but what's the big advantage of our remote then
yeah
no that's extra that's extra that's right
that's an option poland something polish supplier
don't you think we can if we can count this as v as one button and integrate
th uh these buttons in three then we save a lot of money as well
yeah that's a point
yep
no
yeah but uh we have to stick to the twelve and a half euros we don't have any more budget to develop it yeah so
it is if you leave out the l c display and if you use less buttons
say or you can take the single chip
there it is
but then w
good looking
yeah
i think it's uh difficult as well but
or we can leave out the ten buttons and take one scroll wheel for the programme numbers
then w
because then we save ten buttons then we have five and one and and see if we have this one and we've got the advanced
w uh we're getting close
then you will
or maybe you can
um scroll if you scroll you will see the numbers on the l c d display until you've got the right number then you push it
alright it's gotta scroll and push okay but then you you can push uh some other button as well
yeah that's right so if you scroll to a number and then you wait a half second then it g turns to that channel
but it would definitely crop cost a lot and we need the battery

and the regular chip is not possible it has to be advanced
it has to be advanced yeah okay and we can save a euro by a flat design
that's an option we can then we're almost there
yeah so if we
yeah but i think that's that is a big advantage if we're
but
can we use can't we integrate the teletext and the subtitles in one button
if you push it three times
yeah
ah that's not really that
no
i think if you make a good advertisement uh on television and in the in the guide you can explain to the people how to use the scroll wheel
if you just make it real simple
because it saves it saves a lot of money and we can keep our l c d screen which can provide extra information how to use the scroll wheel how to use the other bu buttons as subtitles
and it's good for the innovative design as well if you would erase these
mm eraser
and we put uh
looks a bit odd maybe
that is
something like that then yeah we've got the scroll wheel one two three four five buttons if we erase this one
and these are two buttons then
yeah
yeah
that's really a good good idea i think
and it will make the use of the scroll wheel uh more obvious indeed
so we make one for the volume one for the channel
plus scroll that's right so we've got one two three yeah we can leave the teletext in if we want
that's m that's better
y yeah
mm yeah
uh yeah and then you can
that's right
so we can
decrease this one to four buttons
yeah that's no problem
yeah
yeah it's uh it's more the moulds in which they are being made i think single curved is really
easy to just fill in and cases come right out of the machine and single curved you have to have
a different uh different machine than a flat one
i think this is a really easy one um
what does everybody think about a flat or a single curved design freek what do you think
yeah
yep

we have to cut costs yeah yeah i'm ag
ask for more money
yeah
yeah i am agreeing with the usability yeah
yeah but th um i think we can then keep the single curved one just to
express our l c d screen a bit more so people will use it more and especially
for the help functions it will be good if we have scroll bar scroll button it will
be necessary to have good help function as well
so this is scroll
i think it was better to have this price list a bit earlier before we went on to the to the whole design
but
i'm glad we could make a bit
it's pretty different if you saw the last one than this one
yeah it will
yeah
no but i think
i think the most
that's right we can let l we can stick it out a bit like a old old buttons maybe that's recognisable for them as well yeah that's a good one
so i'm afraid we have to move on and it's uh it's b uh less
frightening i think if they see this design they think oh there are only five buttons and uh
but we will see
yeah that's definitely right
yeah
i would buy it
that's right i would buy it if i was six no i don't know what it costs under twelve and a half euros no
uh yes they are
no but we can go on with the project evaluation
let's see i can sit down i think we still have fifteen minutes left so we're nice on schedule
um the project process

evaluation criteria that's right that was the the point i forgot
i should
there we are evaluation criteria go ahead we've got five minutes i think for those criteria no we've got fifteen minutes but
uh yes what
uh yeah
okay
yeah that's because my pen failed to upload his data i tried to but it's uh it's giving errors by downloading the software
i think it's fancy
yeah
six
very subtitles buttons yeah seven yeah so we've got twenty cents for our docking station huh
yeah that's right
that's a bit dodgy
i would say four four or five between between four or five
yeah
is it functional
yes
no
think it's uh seven
it was i had them worked out
mm they are ugly not very functional and getting lost
yeah
no i think with our new radio button i think it's uh
i think it's better
i think it
yeah
i would give it a four
then we have to do the three it's the
yes it is yeah
and they wanna put fashion in their products uh in the slogan of the company and we have the removable front cases so i think it's very recognisable yep
we've got a calculate it
mm
n we've gonna we're going to evaluate it
forty nine
forty one
that's
around eighty percent what is it
that's eighty four percent
i think that's a pretty nice score

okay thank you
so
that brings us to the project evaluation
yep
thank you project process did we move through the right phases you think along the process
that's right
so lack of information about prices
okay
uh
okay satisfaction was there room for creativity
no it's because of the finance sheet yeah
the room was yeah
restrictions
internet access
'kay leadership was it clear what everybody had to do uh according to their roles and functions
yeah
teamwork did it work out working together also you two of you with the uh last phase
nice
tasks
okay
were the means sufficient for the tasks uh we had to do or were they too much
smart board
if it wants to download its uh data
failed download
smart board was irritating
so you rather wanted to have a flip over or something else
faster as well i think yeah
flip over
yeah
uh you need a smart board uh application i think
but i think you can yeah should be possible yeah you can export it as image
must yeah must be
so the sharing of the information was uh was okay
uh network yeah pen is here on the table
yeah it's possible
okay
that's nice have we found new ideas for
having this kind of meetings or
yeah
yeah
so
yeah so everybody puts his own score and then it mediates the score and you can get one yeah that's better so that's uh
how do we call
evaluation
criteria
okay
mm any more ideas or questions about the project or about the product
because i think
then that we get to our last sheet
are the costs within the budget
yeah
do we
docking station that's a good point but maybe because of the docking station the price of the remote can also be a little bit higher
uh and i think you can compensate that as well
so i think that shouldn't be the biggest problem because it's very cheap to make as well
do we think we gonna get the twelve and a half million or what was it fifteen
fifteen million i think we will if we gonna export this product
it's innovative especially in america people are pretty decadent
sometimes
you can do more
yeah
just put it on the market for everybody you can you can change markets where by
changing the front covers that's one thing you can change it with so you can also try
to uh reach the younger people by uh putting fancy covers on on the
market just as a test see how it works that's i think a good advantage
yeah
uh uh then i think we can have our little celebration right now
that's it yeah i think we still have to fit in one more questionnaire i think i don't know i didn't get a message
from the from ending of the oh i think i have one now five more minutes oh that's nice
then we still have some questions if somebody has some questions they can ask them now or we can put these in the project folder as well maybe that's



export as picture i think

hmm this is another network i guess
does somebody see the project folder i don't
hmm
my documents
yeah i'll just put it in my documents and uh that's okay
okay
i think i'm going to make our final presentation now
and then i will be back in about ten minutes to show you the final presentation
summary of the project
yeah questionnaire i think you all get a questionnaire in in your room and then i'll meet you in i think about ten minutes or something okay thank you
hopefully my pen will download its software
oh
or data


so
yeah yeah
uh that's just uh the normal uh as th as the normal uh remote controls uh so um
you put it uh you um came in uh page uh one hundred now you can use the
normal uh one to zero buttons and you but you can also uh use the um
button th for uh changing the the channel
s so uh the shifting uh button uh for uh yeah shif shifting up in uh on t on t uh teletext and shifting uh down so
oh yeah


yeah
yeah
yeah yeah
uh or you can build in uh when you press uh one button uh uh yeah
but m yeah we disc discuss that already but uh we think uh old people uh don't
know that uh option so uh they just put in uh put press uh the button and
uh
and uh
oh
yeah
yeah yeah it
yeah yeah just to recognise it so uh
uh yeah and now we don't need uh leds or um
y uh s some uh remote controls uh do it also but um uh because we use the little display we don't uh have to use it uh so
nay
mm
yeah we can u just uh
'kay
mm
yeah
yeah
okay
yeah
uh
sixteen i believe so
uh seventeen
uh with the help button
yeah
yeah
where did uh
uh it's just one button but um
yeah there were uh two uh for one big button but they are uh more expensive than the small ones uh yeah so
it's just a
but i don't don't know if if it's cheaper so uh we've still got four buttons but just um so
you got uh not not a butt button itself but uh on the um
yeah on the chip you've got still uh four uh four buttons so
yeah but

are we gonna buy a um a remote control uh when you can uh use it so um
yeah
we m uh we must um stay below the um below um twelve uh fifty or can't uh go um
nay
is it impossible to
but it is possible to make one uh for uh twelve fifty
i don't think so
s
yeah

but you can't use uh
yeah
but we want to make a
uh so uh uh fancy and a good uh yeah
uh wi with n oh with uh
attractive uh o options so uh you can stay uh below uh twelve fifty so
scroll wheel's one
no it
yeah
yeah
mm
d yeah
hmm
ja ja
yeah or we have to uh skip the subtitle uh button
so yeah
yeah it's a big advantage but um it's
uh yeah
yeah
yeah
but if you push the teletext button twice
it's uh
one m uh one b uh a few buttons
yeah
hmm
yeah
uh yeah
but uh you can make a f quite a big uh remote remote control for uh
just the same price as a small one just uh you only have to pay for the double curved or
single curved it uh it's a bit uh
yeah
yeah
yeah
the th

no
but um
but they know the scroll buttons from uh old radios uh they cal also uh buttons like that for uh changing uh channels so maybe it's uh
yeah yeah
yeah
yeah
mm hmm
but very special so uh

no

mm
yeah
mm 'kay
uh six yeah
mm sh

yeah

mm not really
for old people i i
w yeah four
yeah
n yeah
no
mm m
yeah
mm th yeah
yeah
uh
we have to test it s but
uh yeah true
i go for three so
yeah yeah
yeah
hmm
yeah

yeah but it
yeah
yeah

yeah
yeah
mm
yeah
so
yeah
mm hmm
mm

yeah
but
uh
yeah a flipper's uh easier so
yeah
but if you want to share uh of uh when you make um a
picture like this uh on the presentation it's easier to uh share it with uh other people
uh so uh you can sh save it uh and uh put it on the internet or uh uh in
shared f uh folder or uh sh uh shared directory so
so yeah no
t can uh can you export it uh like a yeah
uh
uh yeah
so you can uh
it's possible
okay
um yeah maybe um uh when we n uh just uh give the numbers of of uh
uh uh o one of uh out of s uh sev um it's uh easier to uh
to do the th things that are like that on a computer uh so uh just l uh
like uh at u university uh
so
yeah
yeah
mm
mm yeah
mm
yeah
yeah mm
yeah
ah
ah
ah
hmm
where's the champagne
uh i believe y uh
okay
yeah

yeah

uh maybe uh they will save it so uh
okay
uh maybe we have to fill uh another questionnaire so uh
yeah
yeah
okay



okay
well this is what me and richard came up with the default spot for the on off button the mute button just below that then there's the volume and channel selectors
simple plus minus button uh we thought of a help button if you hold it and you press another button uh the help goes to the l c d screen
then there's the zero to one to zero buttons a button for teletext a button for the subtitles and the company logo
so it's rather simple prototype and uh we'll have to see from testing uh how the users take it
sure uh just pop in at any time
i think if you look at
most controls they've got more buttons than this and well the on off button it's it's a necessity you can't drop that one the volume and channel buttons you need you obviously need those those
the mute button could be replaced uh by pressing the volume down button twice so we
could cancel that one i think the help button really is necessary
because there's no other way to know when someone wants to know what a button does
well you can't
leave out the number buttons i guess
and

yeah so it's rather basic already
yeah they're it's rather hard to draw on the white board but they're supposed to be equal sized
round with a with a little logo on it for the for the volume the
the triangle and stuff just for recognition
so and for the materials we've just chosen for rubber buttons with a a different colour than the case so they jump out
and uh that's about it
yep
yes

yep
yep
yeah
yeah
yes
uh that's that's a big cost
if we leave out the display we can also save money on the chip
which isn't the the docking station isn't even in this c s schematic
so it's not even taken into the price
we we could save money on it but would it make the remote more usable for elderly people
my mother can't even send send an s m s message
so
yeah
the margin will get too small yeah
ten

no remote
that's
we're getting closer
yeah
you could just not scroll for a half a second
so you won't need a button

if you want to use an l c d screen you you need an advanced chip yes
yep
yeah if you v could just leave out one more button
yeah
i think so yeah
what if you have to scroll to page eighty eight eight hundred eighty eight
yeah okay
no

we could make two buttons out of that and just um
if you press the volume button you can control the volume with the scroll wheel
so that would save two buttons if you do the same for the channel
more obvious
so if we
yeah so
if we leave out all those buttons perhaps you can go with the flat flat case and make it smaller overall
so if you put the the volume and channel buttons on the same height as the on off button the screen right behi under that than the scroll button
you get a a much smaller remote
and it
sh
yeah
yeah
richard's argument was very good yeah
yep



yeah


six
yeah

four or five yes


no
mm we haven't thought of that one


i think that's a three
i still i think it's too m too fancy too too flashy
twendag sieven an twendag
yeah
yes
yeah that's true
yeah there w there was enough room but the finance uh
yes
yes was okay
the tasks are very structured so you can just do step by step and it's very easy
well the smart board the d d drawing is just a pain in the ass but
the digital the digital pen is very nice
yes yeah
a flip over or a more precise uh
digit yes
no didn't work
yes
yeah

considering we are not going to make a docking station
perhaps
mm hmm



okay
okay
good afternoon sorry i'm a little late got stuck in the traffic
yeah


um is this the moment where we ask or can ask questions about the functionality
um when you're in teletext there usually are buttons where you just you just press it and you g go to the next teletext page
mm hmm
okay
okay um
yeah
yeah
yeah think so that's what i pointed out earlier if you just make a control for just the t v there's just not much to gain here

since it rechargeable
um
damn

wouldn't yeah no that wouldn't be an option
uh d i assume you'd count the volume and channel thingies for two buttons each right
well think actually there're two buttons aren't they
well i was thinking maybe you could just integrate three of those numbers to one button
that would cut the cost
mm hmm
yeah

but i think this really is four buttons anyhow
yes
only the docking station i guess
maybe we should to a different supplier

yeah
yeah that's what i'm wondering
um
well since the market research
indicated that older people spend their money easier more easy maybe it's feasible to just put the price of the remote up a little especially since we have those nice features
it would be a be a pretty rigid one

or b
basically becoming a choice between like either a good remote and a higher production cost or just any other remote control
but how does scroll wheel work here
that would bring up the price of the scroll wheel also
integrated scroll wheel push button but yeah
i think that would be like the end of our usability

yeah but

well think it's pretty much the teletext subtitles are right now you just push the teletext button go to page eight eight eight and teletext disappears but the subtitles stay there
i think that's the case on most
well that could be just uh like the scroll to eight click scroll to eight click scroll to eight click
but then again that would be d j just pretty much not an option for older people who don't even know what a scroll wheel is
holding a
remote with which they expect to have like ten buttons for the numbers one to zero
with only five buttons on it
and a scroll wheel
true true
that's a pretty big scroll wheel

so this is five buttons
right now we have five
mm
well i still think we should go for the single curve design but then again
all these changes are not really okay with me but since
we just have to
i'd rather just go to the board and
get us to spend eighteen dollars a a remote
or do some market research and see what the options are
yeah
yes definitely
yeah
it's pretty different but this is not really like for the group we were making our remote this will really require a lot of marketing
to get this to sell
'cause if older people like familiar forms and familiar stuff this is not familiar for them
so we're gonna have to do a lotta convincing them
yeah
that's true might uh might be confusing too
they'd be like what only five buttons
yeah but you're not sixty
mm hmm
so um i like set up all these criteria
and evaluation of the
thingy

thank you
five more minutes
okay
'kay so i did some literature study study and analysis of the requirements we set up earlier
translated it into criteria which would be these um is the remote fancy the shape look and feel innovative what new functions are there uh easy to use
uh learnability is a very important factor here uh is it functional are there not too many functions uh among the functions and are the those functions that are there are they useful and the cost
the target group is the remote really for the group we're making it for and recognability if our company is if it is easily recognisable that our company made it
and
so we're supposed to evaluate it right now
let's see
oh i have to say this was a little hard because the minutes of our last meeting
were not here
okay
interesting
so
is the design fancy on a scale of one to seven
we all go for six good
um is the design innovative
i think so with our l c d screen docking station scroll buttons
seven
should be do able is the design easy to use
well
would be for us but
i'd go for four too
is the design functional um do we have all functions that we want to include
i think we do do we have too many functions i don't think so it's pretty slim
seven
oh and do we um
take care of the biggest frustrations of the remote control like it getting lost and
r s i influences think we do
are the production costs within the preset limits well they are now
does the design fit the group of focus
yeah i think it doesn't
i don't know
i think
i think a radio button is not exactly what older people expect to have a remote control
i'm not sure i think i'd go for two
'kay
is the company company recognisable well we have the logo there
so
yeah
so that will be this
i was also supposed to calculate the score but
thought we would have another private thingy after this
is this like after this are we done or
we're gonna go to our other room again
well anyhow these are seven factors times seven is forty
something two
no nine
uh minus one
minus three minus four
minus four
so that would be minus eight
forty one out of forty nine
okay
guess i'll just type that in on the bottom here
hmm 'kay so that will be the evaluation

think we should have a should have had the finance thingy a lot earlier
in the design phase
yeah
definitely
no
not too much no
yeah true but
and i would've liked to go for the
younger users also
and just to be able to access internet and
get something of your own
yeah
mm hmm

yeah yeah
yeah
yeah i tried to open the file on my laptop but
not possible
yeah
no
should've done that then
pen is here

mm yeah
mm hmm
yeah
they are
yeah
fifty grand
yeah
yeah still i think i mean if we're n gonna make a scroll button anyway
it'd be more for the younger people than for the older people so maybe we should just re focus
or specifically for younger people
that's true
yeah i think then it would be way more uh popular with younger people than it is than would be with
older people
even if it were their covers
but
party party
'kay
oh you did
mm hmm

yeah


yeah it probably will
oh yeah you're supposed to make a final
are we supposed to go into our own rooms again
yeah
yeah
that'd be nice
okay who wants to take notes today
okay

what th okay yeah
i'll make funny drawings
yep
thank you
very interesting start of the meeting everyone's looking down reading
yep

hmm she never said that
and i'm being like i don't know not a native speaker of english i think is but what whatever
oh we'll see
yeah i'll uh look at it like when my usual working hours are like
no actually not but i'm never online on the morning so
yeah yep
well
yeah do what you wanna do with it first and then i'll will look at yeah uh yeah and i'll send it out to you again tomorrow or whatever yeah
probably wanna think about if we wanna change our goals and stuff i think it um one thing that we could probably skip uh totally is the removing things from the audio files
that's no i don't th that's that's too big yeah
no
yeah

yeah but that's definitely one thing we could just remove
yeah
yeah
i mean we haven't really yeah
yeah
he he d he doesn't have to know exactly what i mean
yeah m i mean it's hot finished but it doesn't really say

yeah

hmm
i don't know shall we change the deadlines
yeah should we i don't know do you think mike about our things that we had together should we i mean now yeah i mean we have it now like inverted and you have the other but what about the m
removing disfluencies shall we just
yeah we just keep it together on the the pap there right now and just see what what
no not the disfluencies no haven't

yeah yeah might be yeah
yeah
something

yeah
yeah my intent is to work on these things tomorrow a bit more so also i don't know if we send it in on the afternoon maybe i can add a few sentences too when i'm done

then it's done and if it's not hopefully it won't be oh yep
yeah yeah we'll see
well i was still like struggling with java stuff but yeah but i'll work
on it um i think uh i was wondering about that is uh i haven't looked at it so much but
if m any of you guys know how we could do the like from the uh
extract words that you did like also in uh in this extract t time stamps on
stuff so we can is it
yeah
okay
okay
okay
okay
okay
okay
yeah so now i could just put it in some
tuple or something yeah
what on the
okay
mm
yeah i'll take a look at that


pop ups
all of them no
what do you say



okay

no we haven't
yeah that's true
yeah
yeah like
yeah
yeah
yeah that's what and that's what i think we like
okay
i mean we're not really uh well i mean
we're not gonna do much more than just look at the
the rem like the text problem with disfluencies 'cause we're not gonna search it and we're not gonna like listen to it
since we're not doing the audio thing
so i guess just to displaying it is a alright but well anyway yeah
no
well that is true
it's probably best and do as you said like just like yeah no no
yeah



i have a friend there too
yeah
yeah
yeah maybe asleep yeah um
what
i don't know it doesn't matter for me either but
yeah i mean if we both yeah
yeah yeah and correct back any he like things that i thought was wrong in english or whatever it like no that's not that or whatever
yeah
oh it's sad i write wrote like four lines of whatever um yeah twelve thirty tomorrow with
steve

yeah yeah
okay
okay
yeah
yeah

okay yeah basically that's fine yeah
yeah we could because this could be just some uh a little just just describe some screen shots or something
yeah you can either have and we can just ignore that bit or you can have
yeah
yeah you can either have the yeah it says screen shot there and stuff but th you can either have screen shots by the thing each one or um have just a bunch of 'em in one session it doesn't
yeah i've written the topic segmentation one
uh it should be alright do we d
i think pernilla should do it
yeah yeah uh yeah exactly she's only gonna tell us we got it wrong anyway so
i'm only joking


th you can you can perfect it and

sleep sleep food sleep

sabotage it yeah

yeah
nah
it's a good thing to have to say we cou what we could have done if we had more time a good future work thing isn't it stick in the conclusion of the final report should if we had more time this is what we would have done yeah
yeah if yeah if
we don't think there's enough time
or we felt there were more important things to do with our time than
than worry about
yeah that's a good idea you have should have a section probably
the best file on target or something
or t well
and so i've only got six days to do the topic segmentation as well jesus
yeah uh
speaker characterisation
jesus
speaker characterisation's supposed to be done already yeah two days ago
give me a week and i'll tell you the answer to that
or maybe the speaker characterisation might get slimmer
probably we won't disappear it yeah
yeah yeah yep
yeah we won't make it disappear but we might thin it down a bit
um but we might not you know but we might have time depends how how how how things m
the topic segmentation with the l c seg and text tiles basically done it just needs to be done because you know what i mean the co yeah tuned yeah a search through the parameters or something let's see what happens
yeah pretty much
yeah yeah yeah certainly
how about the underlying data for it for the d inverted file how's that coming along
yeah
coming along
easy yeah just yeah well it just um when he pulls up the segments um
part of that one of the f one of the attributes you do get attributes get attributes it returns a list of attributes
search through those and and then it just you can that will tell you what attributes it's got and then you can either do it automatically or
you can just hard code and say look get me the time stamps so you just say um get
attribute and put i think it's i think the method's called get attribute and just it's called start time and end time and that will tell you the
start times and end times i think it returns it double
yeah that's on the um the n the the nom right elements the the the uh the object is a nom right element i think
that should uh tell you what it is
what have th th uh you confuse me do you have um three separate windows for the three separate different types of results
okay not not three different okay okay cool yeah okay right yep
yeah
yeah or tabs or something
yeah yeah it's three panes
it's called a nite text pane or something isn't it is it
text area or something something like that yeah
nom text yeah mostly things are called nom yeah
nite object model i think nite object model i think that's what
with the um
the removing the disfluencies have you done anything with that yet anybody
'cause um i was wondering how we're gonna write it back to h t m l
i mean x m l if we take if we did the processing
writing it back to x m l
seems
there's a blop of text
text file
you will very much limit what you can do with it if it's not in x m l format there is some bizarre method that puts things back into x m l format but
what
oh select what we want just take bits of the x m l and take only it takes certain segments yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah certain segments okay yeah yeah alright
okay that
it says something different there that's what
then written to a written to a file i kinda doubt just that it would ever be done but that will mean that you can only do things on actually no uh 'cause you need to do things on word level so yeah that's fine
yeah
yeah
it's fine yeah
yeah but it would
it would just be blurb like a summary it won't look like it won't say speaker x says this speaker y says that speaker z says this and
yeah then it will look ugly probably 'cause it will look just black and white unless you want as dark colouring
no no i don't think that's i think it's true
it does it on the fly anyway didn't it so
so then just goes through it and says if this word equals that then print

just a bunch of if statements is
yeah you probably could actually this is probably and that's probably not that much more difficult you just fatten the code out a bit i it would be the same thing
and they can't yeah exactly
shouldn't no it's just uh they'd just be if statements when they fast if statements aren't they this is loads of if statements
well is that
i wouldn't wanna have to put it take to put it back into x m l with java even trying to read it in x m l with java was complicated enough i gave up doing that completely and just defaulted back to n uh nite stuff 'cause it was much much much easier
so if we can do it with nite stuff do it with nite stuff i think otherwise you're gonna be s java trying to do s it was just so complicated it was ridiculous
don't believe it you have to d start defining object models like the nite thing and getting all bizarre w weird things it was mad
yeah

i spoke to
yeah it's always it's is it
it's just a it's just a for loop really should be fine yeah
yeah
yeah i included a future work in my own section but
i just said i said what i've done so far and what i'm gonna do and some pro some issues
i think you lose the
you might lose a bit of continuity if you do that though that's what i was thinking but sometimes it's easier to have the top it in its own its sections if you see what i mean so you talk about speaker characterisation you say what you've done and
goals or something something bullet pr bullet bullet points yeah because if you have a discursive thing here and then another discursive thing there if they're not together you lose a lot of the um the continuity i think
but um
so apart from that yeah

yeah
you stick it together she'll shine it

yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
s steve o

twelve days and write yeah not much without any of us
no
yeah

okay
i like the timeline

uh b let me see it oh that's the same oh very good
um i'm not sure uh if we need the outline of the prototype i mean what what are we gonna put into that
yeah because i mean that's basically what we're doing here isn't it the whole
yeah
yeah yes yeah

um
yeah well i mean it's up to you if you wanna keep going with that i'm happy to do some as well i have lots of time tonight
um and then uh we'll send it to you and you can do the final revisions i'm sure
i know you're always online you always make me feel bad because uh when i go to bed at like one you're still online you never go to bed
yeah you pretend always busy yeah right yeah so maybe
yeah so
yeah
yeah
oh there's more oh i see oh this is the one that okay
that's what i thought as well i mean do we are we are we actually gonna attempt that
i don't think so either yeah i think that's gonna be a b we don't even know how to approach that at the moment i think
yeah yeah yeah yeah that's right um
um so maybe i mean we we should we should definitely well we could probably not put it under this heading
but put it under changes since the initial specification and say you know we didn't
we decided the the r time is too short whatever
yes
yeah we would prefer to concentrate on the main
and i think we should probably uh comment explicitly on the milestones here as well and say we managed to do
m m meet these milestones at yeah
like you know develop prototype gui we t you know ah yeah we managed that nicely uh
yeah yeah yeah put it put it good

conceptually


and you can say yeah we uh say we are still aiming for the development to be complete on the or something m
whoa
i yeah i
yeah that's right i i really wanna do it i mean it's not it's not gonna be difficult if at least have all the information pop up that is already in the meta data file that's gonna be no work at all so it's definitely gonna be something there
yeah it might turn out easier than thought
um


yeah sounds good
what else
we should probably d sorry we should probably do another responsibility of packages as well that's what he hinted that we should also um indicate who who is responsible for what from now on
well you could put you know yeah i don't know
so um
have you managed any further on the search thing
alright
that's nice
yeah yeah yeah

so w is there um did you have you made uh another m browser is there something that i should
not since you looked at it last no but i will tonight that's the point
no after the weekend weekend was out
mm hmm yeah yeah
well at the moment is there at the moment is there a window that comes up or is that a r a second results pane or is there you know does the window get larger what's there kind of what are you thinking
mm hmm
yeah
yeah yeah
um
yeah
yeah i quite like the idea of a tab in that case
but you wouldn't want to compare the result the topic one topic result with one summary result would you
actually mm yeah especially if you get if you get results for the same meeting
maybe yeah yeah yeah yeah it's true
yeah i mean we could we could order them by meeting for example
how to order it yeah well i mean uh if you know that's uh you even a second step the first question is do we want to order them how do we wanna order them in the first place
yeah
yeah maybe we should do that
yeah m why don't you just um
colour code those
the results to three different colours
no but if you
if you if you do it straight from you know you get th you get the result and then there's some if statement saying s straight on the you know rock bottom lev level saying if th if you found a segment then colour it print it in red or whatever and
as opposed to
oh right
ah well have a look
oh mm hmm
yeah yeah i can imagine
oh oh i see yeah
you you have to use actions
um yeah i mean um at the moment it works it works with highlighting in in the transcript window doesn't it
so
what do you mean it should work with anything
mm hmm
yeah i mean the whole um the m what fills the transcription box and all of these boxes is a special sort of pane made by nite so i am not sure what it's called now um
um some
um no but i know what it's called and that comes with a whole load of highlighting extras as well as i said you know if you if you left click on something for example it highlights automatically so maybe it comes with something clever as well
yeah
no i'm sure it hasn't got pane in it nite
i don't know text text yeah something like that might yep nom text there is alright yeah why what's nom anyway nite oh




why do you why do we want it in x m l there i mean i thought we'd we'd just selectively selectively write the x m l that we've got
so as as opposed to
yeah t
yeah only only print out certain um certain segments the segments that we want just selectively at the moment it prints out all of them we'll just put an if loop in it that leaves out some of the print statements not not store it at all whatsoever
because
oh right
yeah
so what
yeah yeah you don't really need to do much more with it yeah that's right
i don't think it's gonna take long to to produce anyway it's just another um i mean these meetings are not endlessly long it's just words and to print all of them out selectively
yeah
yeah
um
you could nearly do it together with with uh the transcription with the original transcription have them run parallel
so if certain you know if it's a proper word print it on both both panes and if it's not a proper word then print it only on one but i mean that's that's you know fancy but
but um
yeah
yeah but then
you know the the b the good way of doing it um not together is that you if someone doesn't wanna look at the the you know the chop file then you don't ever have to produce it
so but i mean you can you know you can write we can write something like um we'll try and do it
on the fly and and observe if if that gonna is gonna take too long if it's gonna take too long we'll think about writing
it to a file and doing it off line
yeah i um
oh right
yeah
hmm mm
that's what programming is all about i'm afraid

yeah maybe that's the higher people

well i mean
yeah why don't you put both of both of those ideas in into that that paragraph and say you'll have a look at both or something if you wanna do it i i personally don't wanna mess with uh writing files or anything the moment i wanna do it superficially

yeah
yeah
well it has already learned it anyway
yep yep
so should we all write um a letter or two about future work as well
a word or two
oh right
yeah well maybe you could
maybe you could split that up and
yeah like here is what we've done already and then you know down here
mm
maybe
yeah that's right yeah yeah maybe maybe
mm yeah maybe you're right no
sounds good anything else anyone wants to talk about we're all half asleep aren't we
burnt out

what huh maybe asleep but
uh so we're all still writing our um summaries
sending them to you you send it on to pernilla
how kind
yeah
yeah and then send it on to us so we can nod
okay sounds good i haven't used my pen
oh god
no
oh
channel
mm 'kay l i could take notes this time i guess i'll takes notes this time i guess
actually i suppose i'll use this
um actually first thing i just sorta did a really sorta brief
um yeah version of what we have to do um actually i can just
take that if you want

actually for that i was just copying the one straight out of the other documents so it's all whatever inaccurate and well
but yeah okay um
oh she has she has her own yeah
okay
yeah well just sorta well the thing is yeah we're gonna be touching on all that during the other part for the progress and putting
screen shots and all the rest yeah exact yeah well it's something that he had mentioned in the um in the previous
like just to sort of have a prototype together and so i was just saying that you know we could potentially do that i don't know it's not something we
have to
alter
yeah
yeah sure like the thing is i was thinking even in the stuff that i was doing i mean just throw the screen shots in there when you talk about what you're doing right it kinda makes sense so yeah oh yes oh actually i have a i have that at the very end screen shots but that didn't show up on this page so it's not even relevant so
yeah
yeah anyways so um so yeah this just very general structure um i guess from this we can just pop in our little blurbs and and uh
oh yeah cool
i guess um so i don't know if there's other stuff that you think should be done to this i could do that before i mail it to you guys
um otherwise yeah um did someone else wanna throw it togeth actually i can probably
still throw it together if you want um put your parts into into this one
i'm the perfectionist right yeah
yeah that's a good idea let's just cut out the middle man you know just yeah

yeah
hmm

yeah

oh yeah yeah
yeah
or you just leave your computer on maybe logged in yeah
yeah
yeah actually i noticed that no one is anyways alright
okay so i'll send it off to you then um
yep
okay
right
actually d um
yeah was there anything else we wanted to add to the time line i mean essentially it was what like f um you can't see it right there here i'll s here's the old one well that's that's the orig this the original one yeah yeah which just copied straight out um
mm hmm
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah unless we d unless we discover some sorta time warp thing it's not gonna happen yeah
yeah yeah sure yep
mm hmm
yeah
yeah this this and this or some of them were later some were yeah we could even
yeah
yeah
exactly yeah
yeah more or less yeah search yeah p plus plus or minus three days to yeah yeah that's that that's true too that's true yeah
ah that's plenty you don't have any uh s p n l p assignments do you
yeah
oh really oh jeez h um is are one of those something that you wanna change and delete from our list of expectations
yeah okay alright like should we put i a hint that something like that might happen into the document
okay alright okay yeah i know yeah
mm hmm yeah okay yeah true yeah
okay sounds good
yeah
okay tuned i guess or yeah yeah

cool
mm
okay
right yeah well i could probably just copy that straight out of the other one as well that's essentially the same as it was maybe more detailed specifically
mm
split those apart yeah i think so yeah like yeah inverted file yeah exactly
oh well if we're skipping the audio one and then things got easier um
yeah yeah have you taken any more of a look at it have you taken any more of a look at it at the disfluenc okay yeah okay we could probably
i know if we'll have time to look at that before tomorrow we could just make it up like i'll claim one you'll claim the other for the search things and then we could leave that one as a a joint one
and that'd be good 'kay
um i found finally today something that i can build it in and it uh i should have something for tomorrow i should
uh you know at least very least have uh um a gui and uh wire i'll be wiring that
in hopefully tomorrow morning so i wanna get something i wanna see this i wanna get it together have an image in my mind and i just wanna see
it on the thing and then get a nice screen shot so
um
mm hmm
well w well well it doesn't really matter i mean you could write the sentences first as well
i mean with the intention that this is done i mean and also some sometimes it's a bit of a motivating
factor too i mean you write down the words and the ideas as oh okay well i'll do this i'll do that you know it just all falls together
hmm
oh
oh yeah
um there is but i w i haven't made a lot of changes to it so i might just um delete what
i've done and copy again from yours 'cause i'm sure you've probably made some changes already oh really since friday
okay i thought you said okay oh right i see okay i thought you said that you had written some things
that maybe have caused some bugs and that you were gonna fix those on the weekend or something no okay alright
alright yeah okay right okay cool um yeah so if
you although there's stuff out there that actually i'm gonna try and minimise the amount of changes i make to m browser anyways
shouldn't um
shouldn't be an issue actually just to clarify last week when we were talking about our search results um like if we have topics
as well as transcripts as well as what was the other summaries um do we want separate result panes
uh for each of those or do we want them all in one pane with like an icon or a different colour or something to indicate what type of
result they are so that when they you know click on that it's gonna go to the relevant thing like just if they check
all three say topics summaries blah blah blah have three different windows come up
or three like sub sub panes sort of
um
what um i thought what we sorta discussed last week was to have it sort um the same
window um so it'll be on the search window bottom half of the search window um i don't know if we still wanna keep it that
way but that's uh that's what i was gonna be working so so it's just like you click those and it's just loads up indicating
an action being performed you know splits that thing into like two or three or whatever that is one two or three depending on which ones you check and then um so
if we wanna do it that way you know like it probably doesn't matter too much just trying to think if there's gonna be any other issues
down the road um depending on
no just just panes just result panes for each of the three no no no no no no
no so so it's just when we click you know topics and summaries for what we wanna search then it'll uh indicating an action being performed you know there'll
be two result panes so for one for topics one for i don't not really tabs um but then you can't see
all of them at the same time and it's just like
well it's no but the thing is if you're looking if you could check them both um you wanna see all the results
yeah exactly yeah so the summary and the topic and the transcript are um so um or we could just put them all into one result pane on that same window and just indicate
yeah yeah oh yeah i guess that was the other thing whether we wanna have this reorder by columns and all that but that's a hassle too it's a lot of work
yeah i think yeah probably by meeting makes most sense i mean essentially they're tem you know in time order so yeah that kinda makes most sense
least uh
yeah yeah should be an easy no i don't know actually should be fairly easy i guess
yeah
thinking sometimes in a case like that like a run across um in other languages just that it's hard to tell
what kind of object it was originally once it's put into like a list box or something it's hard to tell whether it was a a transcript
or whatever and then if we're highlighting something in a transcript window it may be difficult to get that information back
once it's just in a list box an item in a list box so let's
there's yeah whereas if it's coming from
yeah
right
yeah yeah it's just silly
yeah um yeah it's just like from past experience i've there's goofy little things that happen and it just
doesn't let you save certain things and it's just kinda um trying to to do a different kind of to go
to a different window so if you wanna go to the actual highlight the transcript or highlight the topic or highlight the summary
at that point that's sorta where it starts getting a little bit tricky 'cause you're working with an event handler within the one panel or list box
or whatever it is and uh
so um there are ways around it but you know whether i'll be able to figure something out like that till before tomorrow yeah i know or delegates or whatever the all that stuff so anyways
right i think so
i think he was saying that as long as we implement that um interface um it should
work with anything that we do like highlighting the yeah i think that was um who is saying that
um wasn't jonathan saying something about that i think it was just like as long as we implement one of these interfaces for this particular type
of window we should be able to have that highlighting happen i don't know i don't
anyways
okay
okay
okay okay alright
okay
okay maybe i should maybe i should use that as well in my yeah okay
hmm
yeah why yeah
okay that makes sense
mm
no
um
it's i thought we were just going to have that as words like not ev not as x m l just sort of as a was that what was that um what transcripts recent oh no transcript no 'cause then we need all the other data if we wanna keep it a transcript right
yeah
yeah that's true yeah good point
hmm
oh yeah okay then that's then that's not yeah yeah i know that's sorta what we were thinking before actually but this makes more sense
yeah
yeah if we're gonna do the x m l then fine that's that probably makes it easier
mm hmm
as text you mean
the thing is like well how would we display the like if we do take disfluencies out and just c you know create a text file take the disfluencies out of the text file and then yeah
unless we extract that out of the file when we create the text file yeah that's true too
yeah
yeah


yeah
mm hmm
right
yeah
yeah or i don't know i was just thinking as well i mean we could probably even use like x s l t to kinda just
transform it and you know flip it into uh yeah just uh transforms um like um
style sheet the um x m l style sheet and then it's kinda like there's usually things built in to well should be built
into java i mean to process x m l into like in just creates whatever file it's gonna be
in uh it's been a f couple of years since i've looked into anything like this but uh that might even be an easier way
and then that way we could even pre process that before hand i don't know do well we don't wanna have to do that right although
on the fly it's typic it's it's typically pretty fun
oh right oh really okay yeah
yeah

yeah okay yeah
okay yeah
yeah okay are you serious
it's insane
actually i was thinking i might try and talk to who is it jonathan and jean like just to see h what they what system they used
to develop this stuff 'cause it would be nice to have all the tools there and just like have the object model and just kind of like plug and play with
everything and just to actually use the system you know at a higher level rather than kinda you know playing around with a little bit of code
and modifying their code and doing this and that it'd be nice to just sorta see what they're doing so i might uh try and contact
them see if there's i don't know
any other hints they could give us just to get things i don't know moving at a higher level i guess
it seems it'd be more interesting to use it as a a real developer would
'cause just seems like a little tinkering here and there and just adding couple things and i don't know so
a channel
n no no it shouldn't be no it should be higher level it should be conceptual and you know coming up with the
the brilliant ideas and then just yeah bringing those to reality
yeah i don't know
hmm
hmm
yeah
like the thing that i was thinking there is well is that once it's done for a f you know one meeting it's done and it's there it's file text file
or x m l or whatever it is but yeah just i don't know just it doesn't make any difference really either way to me
it's like hmm if it's fast enough on the fly then sure um that's about the only issue i have with on the fly whether it's
fast enough
hmm
especially with java and all this other crap it's just if it's loading the file and doing all the rest and processing the p
yeah
right
yeah whether it runs out of memory hmm
um

yeah yeah
right actually yeah that makes sense
um oh like into each separate i know yeah
yeah act
okay i think that does make sense but maybe at the end maybe just uh a point form of you know things that we're still working on things that we'll do yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah
yeah i know what you mean
yep yeah actually i'll just

oh that's true
hmm 'kay

yeah snore okay
or or she'll just take she can take it from now doesn't matter or do you want to or no uh
okay i c i can yeah sure if you wanna send them to me that's fine yeah okay actually no no n actually that's a good idea i'll take one quick
look over try and get it as good as i think that we yeah
okay

purely a formality
right okay we're changing dialogue back to hello jean no okay
oh
i have
okay
oh oh right okay
well i thought you had tomorrow off
